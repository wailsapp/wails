# README

This is an example application showcasing the ContentProtection option.

1. `wails build`
2. run the new binary in `./build/bin/`
3. start screen recording software (Google Meet, Zoom, OBS, native screen recording software)
4. the window won't appear during capture

This works with many screen recording software applications. If Zoom still shows the application, 
this option will need to be selected for it to respect window filtering. `Settings > Share Screen > Advanced > Screen capture mode > Advanced capture with window filtering`

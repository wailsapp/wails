## About

This template uses vanilla JS / HTML and CSS. [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/) is used for processing and bundling the files.

## Building 

To build this project in debug mode, use `wails build`. For production, use `wails build -production`.
To generate a platform native package, add the `-package` flag.

## Live Development

To run in live development mode, run `wails dev` in the project directory. In another terminal, go into the `frontend` 
directory and run `npm run dev`. The frontend dev server will run on http://localhost:5000. Connect to this
in your browser and connect to your application.

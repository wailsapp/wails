## Live Development

To run in live development mode, run `wails dev` in the project directory. In
another terminal, go into the `frontend` directory and run `npm run dev`. The
frontend dev server will run on http://localhost:34115. Connect to this in your
browser and connect to your application.

## Building

To build a redistributable, production mode package, use `wails build`.

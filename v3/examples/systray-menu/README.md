# Systray Menu Example

This example creates a system tray with an attached window and a menu. 
The window is hidden by default and toggled by left-clicking on the systray icon.
The window will hide automatically when it loses focus.
Right-clicking on the systray icon will show the menu.

On Windows, if the icon is in the notification flyout, 
then the window will be shown in the bottom right corner.

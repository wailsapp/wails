# v3

This directory is experimental. It probably won't work for you. There's no support for this directory. Dragons be here. You have been warned!

The examples in this directory may or may not compile / run at any given time.  But the general method to try them out is as follows:

## Running the examples

    cd v3/examples/<example>
    go mod tidy
    go run .

## Compiling the examples

    cd v3/examples/<example>
    go mod tidy
    go build
    ./<example>

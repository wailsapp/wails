# Systray Custom Example

This example creates a simple system tray and uses hooks to attach a custom window. 
The window is hidden by default and toggled by left-clicking on the systray icon.
The window will hide automatically when it loses focus.

On Windows, if the icon is in the notification flyout, 
then the window will be shown in the bottom right corner.

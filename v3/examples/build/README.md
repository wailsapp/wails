# Build

Wails has adopted [Taskfile](https://taskfile.dev) as its build tool. This is optional
and any build tool can be used. However, Taskfile is a great tool, and we recommend it.

The Wails CLI has built-in integration with Taskfile so the standalone version is not a
requirement.

## Building

To build the example, run:

```bash
wails3 task build
```

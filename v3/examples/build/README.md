# Build

Wails has adopted [Taskfile](https://taskfile.dev) as its build tool. This is
optional and any build tool can be used. However, Taskfile is a great tool, and
we recommend it.

The Wails CLI has built-in integration with Taskfile so the standalone version
is not a requirement.

## Building

To build the example, run:

```bash
wails run -t build
```

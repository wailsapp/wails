# Systray Basic Example

This example creates a simple system tray with an attached window. 
The window is hidden by default and toggled by left-clicking on the systray icon.
The window will hide automatically when it loses focus.

On Windows, if the icon is in the notification flyout, 
then the window will be shown in the bottom right corner.

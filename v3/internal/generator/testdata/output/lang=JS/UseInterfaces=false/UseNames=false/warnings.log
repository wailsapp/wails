dynamically registered event names are not discoverable by the binding generator: it is recommended to invoke `application.RegisterEvent` with constant arguments only
event 'collision' has multiple conflicting definitions and will be ignored
events registered through indirect calls are not discoverable by the binding generator: it is recommended to invoke `application.RegisterEvent` directly
generic wrappers for calls to `application.RegisterEvent` are not analysable by the binding generator: it is recommended to call `application.RegisterEvent` with concrete types only

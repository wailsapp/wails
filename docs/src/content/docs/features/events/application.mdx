Application events are triggered by application-level state changes such as application startup, theme changes, and power events. You can listen for these events using the `OnApplicationEvent` method:


```go
app.Event.OnApplicationEvent(events.Mac.ApplicationDidBecomeActive, func(event *application.ApplicationEvent) {
    app.Logger.Info("Application started!")
})

app.Event.OnApplicationEvent(events.Windows.SystemThemeChanged, func(event *application.ApplicationEvent) {
		app.Logger.Info("System theme changed!")
		if event.Context().IsDarkMode() {
			app.Logger.Info("System is now using dark mode!")
		} else {
			app.Logger.Info("System is now using light mode!")
		}
	})
```

## Common Application Events

Common application events are aliases for platform-specific application events. These events are triggered by application-level state
changes such as application startup, theme changes, and power events.

Here is the same example as above, but using common application events to make it work across all platforms:

```go
app.Event.OnApplicationEvent(events.Common.ApplicationStarted, func(event *application.ApplicationEvent) {
    app.Logger.Info("Application started!")
})

app.Event.OnApplicationEvent(events.Common.ThemeChanged, func(event *application.ApplicationEvent) {
    if event.Context().IsDarkMode() {
        app.Logger.Info("System is now using dark mode!")
    } else {
        app.Logger.Info("System is now using light mode!")
    }
})
```

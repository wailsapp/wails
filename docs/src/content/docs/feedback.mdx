<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Bugs" icon="error">

    If you find a bug, please let us know by posting into the [v3 Alpha Feedback](https://discord.gg/bdj28QNHmT) channel on Discord.

    - The post should clearly state what the bug is and have a simple reproducible example. If the docs are unclear what *should* happen, please include that in the post.
    - The post should be given the `Bug` tag.
    - Please include the output of `wails doctor` in your post.
    - If the bug is behavior that does not align with current documentation, e.g. a window does not resize properly, please do the following:
      - Update an existing example in the `v3/example` directory or create a new example in the `v3/examples` folder that clearly shows the issue.
      - Open a [PR](https://github.com/wailsapp/wails/pulls) with the title `[v3 alpha test] <description of bug>`.
      - Please include a link to the PR in your post.

    :::caution

    _Remember_, unexpected behavior isn't necessarily a bug - it might just not do
    what you expect it to do. Use `Suggestions` for this.

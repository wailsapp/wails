## Overview

The Wails CLI (`wails3`) provides commands for creating, developing, building, and managing Wails applications.

## Coming Soon

This section is under construction. For now, use `wails3 --help` or `wails3 [command] --help` for command documentation.

**Common commands:**

```bash
wails3 init          # Create a new project
wails3 dev           # Run in development mode
wails3 build         # Build the project
wails3 generate      # Generate bindings or runtime
wails3 doctor        # Check development environment
```

### Changed

- Renamed `AbsolutePosition()` to `Position()` by
  [mmghv](https://github.com/mmghv) in
  [#3611](https://github.com/wailsapp/wails/pull/3611)
- Update linux webkit dependency to webkit2gtk-4.1 over webkitgtk2-4.0 to
  support Ubuntu 24.04 LTS by [atterpac](https://github.com/atterpac) in
  [#3461](https://github.com/wailsapp/wails/pull/3461)
- The bundled JS runtime script is now an ESM module: script tags importing it
  must have the `type="module"` attribute. By
  [@fbbdev](https://github.com/fbbdev) in
  [#3295](https://github.com/wailsapp/wails/pull/3295)
- The `@wailsio/runtime` package does not publish its API on the `window.wails`
  object, and does not start the WML system. This has been done to improve
  encapsulation. The WML system can be started manually if desired by calling
  the new `WML.Enable` method. The bundled JS runtime script still performs both
  operations automatically. By [@fbbdev](https://github.com/fbbdev) in
  [#3295](https://github.com/wailsapp/wails/pull/3295)
- The Window API module `@wailsio/runtime/src/window` now exposes the containing
  window object as a default export. It is not possible anymore to import
  individual methods through ESM named or namespace import syntax.
- The JS window API has been updated to match the current Go `WebviewWindow`
  API. Some methods have changed name or prototype, specifically: `Screen`
  becomes `GetScreen`; `GetZoomLevel`/`SetZoomLevel` become `GetZoom`/`SetZoom`;
  `GetZoom`, `Width` and `Height` now return values directly instead of wrapping
  them within objects. By [@fbbdev](https://github.com/fbbdev) in
  [#3295](https://github.com/wailsapp/wails/pull/3295)
- The binding generator now uses calls by ID by default. The `-id` CLI option
  has been removed. Use the `-names` CLI option to switch back to calls by name.
  By [@fbbdev](https://github.com/fbbdev) in
  [#3468](https://github.com/wailsapp/wails/pull/3468)
- New binding code layout: output files were previously organised in folders
  named after their containing package; now full Go import paths are used,
  including the module path. By [@fbbdev](https://github.com/fbbdev) in
  [#3468](https://github.com/wailsapp/wails/pull/3468)
- The struct field `application.Options.Bind` has been renamed to
  `application.Options.Services`. By [@fbbdev](https://github.com/fbbdev) in
  [#3468](https://github.com/wailsapp/wails/pull/3468)
- New syntax for binding services: service instances must now be wrapped in a
  call to `application.NewService`. By [@fbbdev](https://github.com/fbbdev) in
  [#3468](https://github.com/wailsapp/wails/pull/3468)
- Disable spinner on Non-Terminal or CI Environment by
  [@DeltaLaboratory](https://github.com/DeltaLaboratory) in
  [#3574](https://github.com/wailsapp/wails/pull/3574)

Wails is a framework for building desktop applications using Go and web technologies. It provides native OS integration whilst allowing you to build your UI with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### How does Wails compare to Electron?

**Wails:**
- ~10MB memory usage
- ~15MB binary size
- Native performance
- Go backend

**Electron:**
- ~100MB+ memory usage
- ~150MB+ binary size
- Chromium overhead
- Node.js backend

### Is Wails production-ready?

Yes! Wails v3 is suitable for production applications. Many companies use Wails for their desktop applications.

### What platforms does Wails support?

- Windows (7+)
- macOS (10.13+)
- Linux (GTK3)

## Development

### Do I need to know Go?

Basic Go knowledge is helpful but not required. You can start with simple services and learn as you go.

### Can I use my favourite frontend framework?

Yes! Wails works with:
- Vanilla JavaScript
- React
- Vue
- Svelte
- Any framework that builds to HTML/CSS/JS

### How do I call Go functions from JavaScript?

Use bindings:

```go
// Go
func (s *Service) Greet(name string) string {
    return "Hello " + name
}
```

```javascript
// JavaScript
import { Greet } from './bindings/myapp/service'
const message = await Greet("World")
```

### Can I use TypeScript?

Yes! Wails generates TypeScript definitions automatically.

### How do I debug my application?

Use your browser's dev tools:
- Right-click → Inspect Element
- Or enable dev tools in window options

## Building & Distribution

### How do I build for production?

```bash
wails3 build
```

Your application will be in `build/bin/`.

### Can I cross-compile?

Yes! Build for other platforms:

```bash
wails3 build -platform windows/amd64
wails3 build -platform darwin/universal
wails3 build -platform linux/amd64
```

### How do I create an installer?

Use platform-specific tools:
- Windows: NSIS or WiX
- macOS: Create DMG
- Linux: DEB/RPM packages

See the [Installers Guide](/guides/installers).

### How do I code sign my application?

**macOS:**
```bash
codesign --deep --force --sign "Developer ID" MyApp.app
```

**Windows:**
Use SignTool with your certificate.

## Features

### Can I create multiple windows?

Yes! Wails v3 has native multi-window support:

```go
window1 := app.Window.New()
window2 := app.Window.New()
```

### Does Wails support system tray?

Yes! Create system tray applications:

```go
tray := app.SystemTray.New()
tray.SetIcon(iconBytes)
tray.SetMenu(menu)
```

### Can I use native dialogs?

Yes! Wails provides native dialogs:

```go
path, _ := app.OpenFileDialog().
    SetTitle("Select File").
    PromptForSingleSelection()
```

### Does Wails support auto-updates?

Wails doesn't include auto-update functionality, but you can implement it yourself or use third-party libraries.

## Performance

### Why is my binary large?

Go binaries include the runtime. Reduce size:

```bash
wails3 build -ldflags "-s -w"
```

### How do I improve performance?

- Paginate large datasets
- Cache expensive operations
- Use events for updates
- Optimise frontend bundle
- Profile your code

See the [Performance Guide](/guides/performance).

### Does Wails support hot reload?

Yes! Use dev mode:

```bash
wails3 dev
```

## Troubleshooting

### My bindings aren't working

Regenerate bindings:

```bash
wails3 generate bindings
```

### Window doesn't appear

Check if you called `Show()`:

```go
window := app.Window.New()
window.Show()  // Don't forget this!
```

### Events not firing

Ensure event names match exactly:

```go
// Go
app.Event.Emit("my-event", data)

// JavaScript
OnEvent("my-event", handler)  // Must match
```

### Build fails

Common fixes:
- Run `go mod tidy`
- Check `wails.json` configuration
- Verify frontend builds: `cd frontend && npm run build`
- Update Wails: `go install github.com/wailsapp/wails/v3/cmd/wails3@latest`

## Migration

### Should I migrate from v2 to v3?

v3 offers:
- Better performance
- Multi-window support
- Improved API
- Better developer experience

See the [Migration Guide](/migration/v2-to-v3).

### Will v2 be maintained?

Yes, v2 will receive critical updates.

### Can I run v2 and v3 side by side?

Yes, they use different import paths.

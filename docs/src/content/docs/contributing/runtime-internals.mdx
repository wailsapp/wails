The **runtime** is the layer that transforms ordinary Go functions into a
cross-platform desktop application.  
This document explains the moving parts you will meet when tracing through the
source code.

---

## 1. Application Lifecycle

| Phase | Code Path | What Happens |
|-------|-----------|--------------|
| **Bootstrap** | `pkg/application/application.go:init()` | Registers build-time data, creates a global `application` singleton. |
| **New()** | `application.New(...)` | Validates `Options`, spins up the **AssetServer**, initialises logging. |
| **Run()** | `application.(*App).Run()` | 1. Calls platform `mainthread.X()` to enter the OS UI thread.<br>2. Boots the **runtime** (`internal/runtime`).<br>3. Blocks until the last window closes or `Quit()` is called. |
| **Shutdown** | `application.(*App).Quit()` | Broadcasts `application:shutdown` event, flushes log, tears down windows & services. |

The lifecycle is strictly **single-entry**: you may create many windows, but the
application object itself is initialised once.

---

## 2. Window Management

### Public API

```go
win := app.NewWebviewWindow(&application.WebviewWindowOptions{
    Title:  "Dashboard",
    Width:  1280,
    Height: 720,
})
win.Show()
```

`NewWebviewWindow` delegates to `internal/runtime/webview_window_*.go` where
platform-specific constructors live:

```
internal/runtime/
├── webview_window_darwin.go
├── webview_window_linux.go
└── webview_window_windows.go
```

Each file:

1. Creates a native webview (WKWebView, WebKitGTK, WebView2).
2. Registers a **Message Processor** callback.
3. Maps Wails events (`WindowResized`, `Focus`, `DropFile`, …) to runtime
   event IDs.

Windows are tracked by `screenmanager.go` which offers **query APIs** (all
displays, DPI, active window) and centralises resize / move bookkeeping.

---

## 3. Message Processing Pipeline

The bridge between JavaScript and Go is implemented by the **Message
Processor** family in `pkg/application/messageprocessor_*.go`.

Flow:

1. **JavaScript** calls `window.runtime.Invoke("Greet", "Alice")`.
2. The runtime serialises the request:  
   `{"t":"c","id":"123","m":"Greet","p":["Alice"]}`  
   (`t` = type, `c` = call).
3. **Go** receives this JSON via the webview callback.
4. `messageprocessor_call.go` looks up the bound method in the
   generated table (`application.bindings.go`) and executes it.
5. The result or error is marshalled back to JS where a `Promise` resolves.

Specialised processors:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `messageprocessor_window.go` | Window actions (hide, maximize, …) |
| `messageprocessor_dialog.go` | Native dialogs (`OpenFile`, `MessageBox`, …) |
| `messageprocessor_clipboard.go` | Clipboard read/write |
| `messageprocessor_events.go` | Event subscribe / emit |
| `messageprocessor_browser.go` | Browser navigation, devtools |

Processors are **stateless** – they pull everything they need from the
`ApplicationContext` passed with each message.

## 4. Events System

Events are namespaced strings dispatched across three layers:

1. **Application events**: global lifecycle (`application:ready`,
   `application:shutdown`).
2. **Window events**: per-window (`window:focus`, `window:resize`).
3. **Custom events**: user-defined (`chat:new-message`).

Implementation details:

* Constants are generated from `internal/events/defaults.go`.
* Go side:  
  `app.On("window:focus", func(e application.WindowEvent) {...})`
* JS side:  
  `window.runtime.EventsOn("chat:new-message", cb)`

Under the hood both map to the same **EventBus** in
`pkg/application/events.go`.  
Subscribers are reference-counted; when a window closes, its callbacks are
auto-unregistered to avoid leaks.

---

## 5. Platform-Specific Implementations

Conditional compilation keeps the public API identical while hiding OS wrinkles.

| Concern | Darwin | Linux | Windows |
|---------|--------|-------|---------|
| Main Thread | `mainthread_darwin.go` (Cgo to Foundation) | `mainthread_linux.go` (GTK) | `mainthread_windows.go` (Win32 `AttachThreadInput`) |
| Dialogs | `dialogs_darwin.*` (NSAlert) | `dialogs_linux.go` (GtkFileChooser) | `dialogs_windows.go` (IFileOpenDialog) |
| Clipboard | `clipboard_darwin.go` | `clipboard_linux.go` | `clipboard_windows.go` |
| Tray Icons | `systemtray_darwin.*` | `systemtray_linux.go` (DBus) | `systemtray_windows.go` (Shell_NotifyIcon) |

Key principles:

* **No Cgo on Windows/Linux** unless unavoidable (performance, portability).
* Use **build tags** (`//go:build darwin && !production`) to keep files readable.
* Expose **capabilities** via `internal/capabilities` so higher layers can
  degrade gracefully.

## 6. File Guide

| File | Why You’d Touch It |
|------|--------------------|
| `internal/runtime/runtime_*.go` | Change global startup logic, add debug hooks. |
| `internal/runtime/webview_window_*.go` | Implement a new window hint or behaviour. |
| `pkg/application/messageprocessor_*.go` | Add a new bridge command callable from JS. |
| `pkg/application/events_*.go` | Extend built-in event definitions. |
| `internal/assetserver/*` | Tweak dev/production asset handling. |

---

## 7. Debugging Tips

* Launch with `WAILS_LOG_LEVEL=debug` to print every message crossing the bridge.
* Use `wails3 dev -verbose` to see live reload & asset requests.
* On macOS run under `lldb --` to catch Objective-C exceptions early.
* For Windows Chromium issues, enable WebView2 debug logs:  
  `set WEBVIEW2_ADDITIONAL_BROWSER_ARGUMENTS=--remote-debugging-port=9222`

## 8. Extending the Runtime

1. Define a **capability flag** in `internal/capabilities`.
2. Implement the feature in each platform file using build tags.
3. Add public API in `pkg/application`.
4. Register a new message type or event if JS needs to call it.
5. Update at least one example in `v3/examples/` exercising the feature.

Follow this checklist and you'll keep the cross-platform contract intact.

You now have a guided tour of the runtime internals. Combine this knowledge with
the **Codebase Layout** map and the **Asset Server** docs to navigate confidently
and make impactful contributions. Happy coding!

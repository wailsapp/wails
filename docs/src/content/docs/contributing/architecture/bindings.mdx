This guide explains how the Wails binding system works internally, providing insights for developers who want to understand the mechanics behind the automatic code generation.

## Architecture Overview

The Wails binding system consists of three main components:

1. **Collection**: Analyzes Go code to extract information about services, models, and other declarations
2. **Configuration**: Manages settings and options for the binding generation process
3. **Rendering**: Generates JavaScript/TypeScript code based on the collected information

<FileTree>
- internal/generator/
  - collect/     # Package analysis and information extraction
  - config/      # Configuration structures and interfaces
  - render/      # Code generation for JS/TS
</FileTree>

## Collection Process

The collection process is responsible for analyzing Go packages and extracting information about services, models, and other declarations. This is handled by the `collect` package.

### Key Components

- **Collector**: Manages package information and caches collected data
- **Package**: Represents a Go package being analyzed and stores collected services, models, and directives
- **Service**: Collects information about service types and their methods
- **Model**: Collects detailed information about model types, including fields, values, and type parameters
- **Directive**: Parses and interprets `//wails:` directives in Go source code

### Collection Flow

1. The collector scans the Go packages specified in the project
2. It identifies service types (structs with methods that will be exposed to the frontend)
3. For each service, it collects information about its methods
4. It identifies model types (structs used as parameters or return values in service methods)
5. For each model, it collects information about its fields and type parameters
6. It processes any `//wails:` directives found in the code

## Rendering Process

The rendering process is responsible for generating JavaScript/TypeScript code based on the collected information. This is handled by the `render` package.

### Key Components

- **Renderer**: Orchestrates the rendering of service, model, and index files
- **Module**: Represents a single generated JavaScript/TypeScript module
- **Templates**: Text templates used for code generation

### Rendering Flow

1. For each service, the renderer generates a JavaScript/TypeScript file with functions that mirror the service methods
2. For each model, the renderer generates a JavaScript/TypeScript class that mirrors the model struct
3. The renderer generates index files that re-export all services and models
4. The renderer applies any custom code injections specified by `//wails:inject` directives

## Type Mapping

One of the most important aspects of the binding system is how Go types are mapped to JavaScript/TypeScript types. Here's a summary of the mapping:

| Go Type | JavaScript Type | TypeScript Type |
|---------|----------------|----------------|
| `bool` | `boolean` | `boolean` |
| `int`, `int8`, `int16`, `int32`, `int64`, `uint`, `uint8`, `uint16`, `uint32`, `uint64`, `float32`, `float64` | `number` | `number` |
| `string` | `string` | `string` |
| `[]byte` | `Uint8Array` | `Uint8Array` |
| `[]T` | `Array<T>` | `T[]` |
| `map[K]V` | `Object` | `Record<K, V>` |
| `struct` | `Object` | Custom class |
| `interface{}` | `any` | `any` |
| `*T` | `T \| null` | `T \| null` |
| `func` | Not supported | Not supported |
| `chan` | Not supported | Not supported |

## Directives System

The binding system supports several directives that can be used to customize the generated code. These directives are added as comments in your Go code.

### Available Directives

- `//wails:inject`: Injects custom JavaScript/TypeScript code into the generated bindings
- `//wails:include`: Includes additional files with the generated bindings
- `//wails:internal`: Marks a type or method as module-private — it is still generated in JS/TS bindings but not re-exported from the package index file. Useful with `//wails:inject` for wrapping methods with custom JS
- `//wails:ignore`: Completely excludes a method from binding generation — no JS/TS code is generated for it at all
- `//wails:id`: Specifies a custom ID for a method, overriding the default hash-based ID

### Directive Processing

1. During the collection phase, the collector identifies and parses directives in the Go code
2. The directives are stored with the corresponding declarations (services, methods, models, etc.)
3. During the rendering phase, the renderer applies the directives to customize the generated code

## Advanced Features

### Conditional Code Generation

The binding system supports conditional code generation using a two-character condition prefix for `include` and `inject` directives:

```
<language><style>:<content>
```

Where:
- `<language>` can be:
  - `*` - Both JavaScript and TypeScript
  - `j` - JavaScript only
  - `t` - TypeScript only

- `<style>` can be:
  - `*` - Both classes and interfaces
  - `c` - Classes only
  - `i` - Interfaces only

For example:
```go
//wails:inject j*:console.log("JavaScript only");
//wails:inject t*:console.log("TypeScript only");
```

### Custom Method IDs

By default, methods are identified by a hash-based ID. However, you can specify a custom ID using the `//wails:id` directive:

```go
//wails:id 42
func (s *Service) CustomIDMethod() {}
```

This can be useful for maintaining compatibility when refactoring code.

## Performance Considerations

The binding generator is designed to be efficient, but there are a few things to keep in mind:

1. The first run will be slower as it builds up a cache of packages to scan
2. Subsequent runs will be faster as they use the cached information
3. The generator processes all packages in the project, which can be time-consuming for large projects
4. You can use the `-clean` flag to clean the output directory before generation

## Debugging

If you encounter issues with the binding generation, you can use the `-v` flag to enable debug output:

```bash
wails3 generate bindings -v
```

This will provide detailed information about the collection and rendering process, which can help identify the source of the issue.

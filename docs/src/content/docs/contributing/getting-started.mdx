## Welcome, Contributor!

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Wails! This guide will help you make your first contribution.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- **Go 1.23+** installed ([download](https://go.dev/dl/))
- **Node.js 18+** and **npm** ([download](https://nodejs.org/))
- **Git** configured with your GitHub account
- Basic familiarity with Go and JavaScript/TypeScript

### Platform-Specific Requirements

**macOS:**
- Xcode Command Line Tools: `xcode-select --install`

**Windows:**
- MSYS2 or similar Unix-like environment recommended
- WebView2 runtime (usually pre-installed on Windows 11)

**Linux:**
- `gcc`, `pkg-config`, `libgtk-3-dev`, `libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev`
- Install via: `sudo apt install build-essential pkg-config libgtk-3-dev libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev` (Debian/Ubuntu)

## Fork and Clone

1. **Fork the repository** at [github.com/wailsapp/wails](https://github.com/wailsapp/wails)

2. **Clone your fork:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/wails.git
   cd wails
   ```

3. **Add upstream remote:**

   ```

## Building Wails

Build the Wails v3 CLI:

```bash
cd v3
go build -o ../wails3 ./cmd/wails3
```

This creates a `wails3` binary in the project root. Add it to your PATH or use it directly.

## Testing Your Changes

1. **Run tests:**
   ```bash
   cd v3
   go test ./...
   ```

2. **Test the CLI:**
   ```bash
   cd ..
   ./wails3 init -n testapp
   cd testapp
   ../wails3 dev
   ```

## Making Changes

1. **Create a feature branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-awesome-feature
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following our [Coding Standards](/contributing/standards)

3. **Commit with clear messages:**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add awesome feature"
   ```

   Use conventional commits:
   - `feat:` for new features
   - `fix:` for bug fixes
   - `docs:` for documentation
   - `refactor:` for code refactoring
   - `test:` for test changes

4. **Keep your branch updated:**
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/master
   ```

## Submitting a Pull Request

1. **Push your branch:**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/my-awesome-feature
   ```

2. **Open a PR** on GitHub with:
   - Clear title describing the change
   - Description of what changed and why
   - Reference to any related issues (#123)
   - Screenshots/videos if UI changes

3. **Respond to review feedback** - maintainers may request changes

4. **Celebrate!** Once merged, your contribution is part of Wails

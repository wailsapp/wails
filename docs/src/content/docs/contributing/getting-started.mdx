## Step-by-Step Guide

<Steps>

1. **Fork and Clone**

   Fork the repository at [github.com/wailsapp/wails/fork](https://github.com/wailsapp/wails/fork)

   Then clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/wails.git
   cd wails
   ```

   Add the upstream remote:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/wailsapp/wails.git
   ```

2. **Build Wails**

   Build the Wails v3 CLI:

   ```bash
   cd v3
   go build -o ../wails3 ./cmd/wails3
   ```

   This creates a `wails3` binary in the project root. Add it to your PATH or use it directly.

3. **Verify Your Setup**

   Run tests to ensure everything is working:
   ```bash
   cd v3
   go test ./...
   ```

   Test the CLI:
   ```bash
   cd ..
   ./wails3 init -n testapp
   cd testapp
   ../wails3 dev
   ```

4. **Create a Feature Branch**

   Create a branch for your changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-awesome-feature
   ```

5. **Make Your Changes**

   Make your changes following our [Coding Standards](/contributing/standards)

   Use conventional commits:
   - `feat:` for new features
   - `fix:` for bug fixes
   - `docs:` for documentation
   - `refactor:` for code refactoring
   - `test:` for test changes

   Commit with clear messages:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add awesome feature"
   ```

6. **Keep Your Branch Updated**

   Regularly sync with upstream:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/master
   ```

7. **Submit a Pull Request**

   Push your branch:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/my-awesome-feature
   ```

   Open a PR on GitHub with:
   - Clear title describing the change
   - Description of what changed and why
   - Reference to any related issues (#123)
   - Screenshots/videos if UI changes

8. **Respond to Review Feedback**

   Maintainers may request changes. Make the requested updates and push them to your branch.

9. **Celebrate!**

   Once merged, your contribution is part of Wails!

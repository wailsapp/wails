## Overview

The Wails v3 build system is a flexible and powerful tool designed to streamline
the build process for your Wails applications. It leverages
[Task](https://taskfile.dev), a task runner that allows you to define and run
tasks easily. While the v3 build system is the default, Wails encourages a
"bring your own tooling" approach, allowing developers to customize their build
process as needed.

Learn more about how to use Task in the
[official documentation](https://taskfile.dev/usage/).

## Task: The Heart of the Build System

[Task](https://taskfile.dev) is a modern alternative to Make, written in Go. It
uses a YAML file to define tasks and their dependencies. In the Wails v3 build
system, [Task](https://taskfile.dev) plays a central role in orchestrating the
build process.

The main `Taskfile.yml` is located in the project root, while platform-specific
tasks are defined in `build/<platform>/Taskfile.yml` files. A common `Taskfile.yml`
file in the `build` directory contains common tasks that are shared across
platforms.

<FileTree>

- Project Root
  - Taskfile.yml
  - build
    - windows/Taskfile.yml
    - darwin/Taskfile.yml
    - linux/Taskfile.yml
    - Taskfile.yml

</FileTree>

## Taskfile.yml

The `Taskfile.yml` file in the project root is the main entry point for the build system. It defines
the tasks and their dependencies. Here's the default `Taskfile.yml` file:

```yaml
version: '3'

includes:
  common: ./build/Taskfile.yml
  windows: ./build/windows/Taskfile.yml
  darwin: ./build/darwin/Taskfile.yml
  linux: ./build/linux/Taskfile.yml

vars:
  APP_NAME: "myproject"
  BIN_DIR: "bin"
  VITE_PORT: '{{.WAILS_VITE_PORT | default 9245}}'

tasks:
  build:
    summary: Builds the application
    cmds:
      - task: "{{OS}}:build"

  package:
    summary: Packages a production build of the application
    cmds:
      - task: "{{OS}}:package"

  run:
    summary: Runs the application
    cmds:
      - task: "{{OS}}:run"

  dev:
    summary: Runs the application in development mode
    cmds:
      - wails3 dev -config ./build/config.yml -port {{.VITE_PORT}}


```

## Platform-Specific Taskfiles

Each platform has its own Taskfile, located in the platform directories beneath the `build` directory. These
files define the core tasks for that platform. Each taskfile includes common tasks from the `build/Taskfile.yml` file.

### Windows

Location: `build/windows/Taskfile.yml`

The Windows-specific Taskfile includes tasks for building, packaging, and
running the application on Windows. Key features include:

- Building with optional production flags
- Generating Windows `.syso` file
- Creating an NSIS installer for packaging

### Linux

Location: `build/linux/Taskfile.yml`

The Linux-specific Taskfile includes tasks for building, packaging, and running
the application on Linux. Key features include:

- Building with optional production flags
- Creating an AppImage, deb, rpm, and Arch Linux packages
- Generating `.desktop` file for Linux applications

### macOS

Location: `build/darwin/Taskfile.yml`

The macOS-specific Taskfile includes tasks for building, packaging, and running
the application on macOS. Key features include:

- Building binaries for amd64, arm64 and universal (both) architectures
- Creating an `.app` bundle for distributing
- Setting macOS-specific build flags and environment variables

## Wails3 Commands and Task Execution

The `wails3 task` command is an embedded version of [Taskfile](https://taskfile.dev), which executes
the tasks defined in your `Taskfile.yml`.

The `wails3 build` and `wails3 package` commands are aliases for
`wails3 task build` and `wails3 task package` respectively. When you run these
commands, Wails internally translates them to the appropriate task execution:

- `wails3 build` → `wails3 task build`
- `wails3 package` → `wails3 task package`

## Common Build Process

Across all platforms, the build process typically includes the following steps:

1. Tidying Go modules
2. Building the frontend
3. Generating icons
4. Compiling the Go code with platform-specific flags
5. Packaging the application (platform-specific)

## Customising the Build Process

While the v3 build system provides a solid default configuration, you can easily
customise it to fit your project's needs. By modifying the `Taskfile.yml` and
platform-specific Taskfiles, you can:

- Add new tasks
- Modify existing tasks
- Change the order of task execution
- Integrate with other tools and scripts

This flexibility allows you to tailor the build process to your specific
requirements while still benefiting from the structure provided by the Wails v3
build system.

:::tip[Learning Taskfile]
We highly recommend reading the [Taskfile](https://taskfile.dev) documentation to
understand how to use Taskfile effectively.
You can find out which version of Taskfile is embedded in the Wails CLI by running `wails3 task --version`.

## Development Mode

The Wails v3 build system includes a powerful development mode that enhances the
developer experience by providing live reloading and hot module replacement.
This mode is activated using the `wails3 dev` command.

### How It Works

When you run `wails3 dev`, the following process occurs:

1. The command checks for an available port, defaulting to 9245 if not
   specified.
2. It sets up the environment variables for the frontend dev server (Vite).
3. It starts the file watcher using the [refresh](https://github.com/atterpac/refresh) library.

The [refresh](https://github.com/atterpac/refresh) library is responsible for
monitoring file changes and triggering rebuilds. It uses the configuration defined under the `dev_mode` key in the `./build/config.yaml` file.
It may be configured to ignore certain directories and files, to determine which files to watch and what actions to take when changes are detected.
The default configuration works pretty well, but feel free to customise it to your needs.

### Configuration

Here's an example of its structure:

```yaml
dev_mode:
  root_path: .
  log_level: warn
  debounce: 1000
  ignore:
    dir:
      - .git
      - node_modules
      - frontend
      - bin
    file:
      - .DS_Store
      - .gitignore
      - .gitkeep
    watched_extension:
      - "*.go"
    git_ignore: true
  executes:
    - cmd: wails3 task common:install:frontend:deps
      type: once
    - cmd: wails3 task common:dev:frontend
      type: background
    - cmd: go mod tidy
      type: blocking
    - cmd: wails3 task build
      type: blocking
    - cmd: wails3 task run
      type: primary
```

This configuration file allows you to:

- Set the root path for file watching
- Configure logging level
- Set a debounce time for file change events
- Ignore specific directories, files, or file extensions
- Define commands to execute on file changes

### Customising Development Mode

You can customise the development mode experience by modifying these values in the `config.yaml` file.

Some ways to customise include:

1. Changing the watched directories or files
2. Adjusting the debounce time to control how quickly the system responds to
   changes
3. Adding or modifying the execute commands to fit your project's needs

### Using a browser for development

Whilst Wails v2 fully supported the use of a browser for development, it caused a lot
of confusion. Applications that would work in the browser would not necessarily
work in the desktop application, as not all browser APIs are available in webviews.

For UI-focused development work, you still have the flexibility to use a browser
in v3, by accessing the Vite URL at `http://localhost:9245` in dev mode. This
gives you access to powerful browser dev tools while working on styling and
layout. Be aware that Go bindings *will not work* in this mode.
When you're ready to test functionality like bindings and events, simply
switch to the desktop view to ensure everything works perfectly in the
production environment.

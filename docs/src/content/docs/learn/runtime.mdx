The Wails runtime is the standard library for Wails applications. It provides a
number of features that may be used in your applications, including:

- Window management
- Dialogs
- Browser integration
- Clipboard
- Menus
- System information
- Events
- Context Menus
- Screens
- WML (Wails Markup Language)

The runtime is required for integration between Go and the frontend. There are 2
ways to integrate the runtime:

- Using the `@wailsio/runtime` package
- Using a pre-built bundle

## Using the npm package

The `@wailsio/runtime` package is a JavaScript package that provides access to
the Wails runtime from the frontend. It is used by all standard templates
and is the recommended way to integrate the runtime into your application.
By using the `@wailsio/runtime` package, you will only include the parts of the runtime that you use.

The package is available on npm and can be installed using:

```shell
npm install --save @wailsio/runtime
```

## Using a pre-built bundle

Some projects will not use a Javascript bundler and may prefer to use a
pre-built bundled version of the runtime. This version can be generated locally
using the following command:

```shell
wails3 generate runtime
```

The command will output a `runtime.js` (and `runtime.debug.js`) file in the current
directory. This file is an ES module that can be imported by your application scripts
just like the npm package, but the API is also exported to the global window object,
so for simpler applications you can use it as follows:

```html
<html>
    <head>
        <script type="module" src="./runtime.js"></script>
        <script>
            window.onload = function () {
                wails.Window.SetTitle("A new window title");
            }
        </script>
    </head>
    <!--- ... -->
</html>
```

:::caution
It is important to include the `type="module"` attribute on the `<script>` tag that loads the runtime
and to wait for the page to be fully loaded before calling the API,
because scripts with the `type="module"` attribute run asynchronously.
:::

## Initialisation

Apart from the API functions, the runtime provides support for context menus and window dragging.
These features will only work as expected after the runtime has been initialised.
Even if you don't use the API, make sure to include a side-effect import statement
somewhere in your frontend code:

```javascript
import "@wailsio/runtime";
```

Your bundler should detect the presence of side-effects and include
all required initialisation code in the build.

:::note
If you prefer the pre-built bundle, adding a script tag as shown above suffices.

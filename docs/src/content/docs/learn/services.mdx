Services in Wails v3 provide a powerful way to extend the functionality of your
application. They allow you to create modular, reusable components that can be
easily integrated into your Wails application.

## Overview

Services are designed to encapsulate specific functionality and can be
registered with the application at startup. They can handle various tasks such
as file serving, database operations, logging, and more. Services can also
interact with the application lifecycle and respond to HTTP requests.

## Creating a Service

To create a service, you simply define a struct. Here's a basic structure of a
service:

```go
type MyService struct {
    // Your service fields
}

func NewMyService() *MyService {
    // Initialize and return your service
}

func (s *MyService) Greet(name string) string {
    return fmt.Sprintf("Hello, %s!", name)
}
```

This service has a single method, `Greet`, which accepts a name and returns a
greeting.

## Registering a Service

To register a service with the application, you need to provide an instance of
the service to the `Services` field of the `application.Options` struct.
All services need to be wrapped by an `application.NewService` call.
Here's an example:

```go
app := application.New(application.Options{
    Services: []application.Service{
        application.NewService(NewMyService()),
    },
})
```

This registers the `NewMyService` function as a service with the application.

Services may also be registered with additional options:

```go
app := application.New(application.Options{
    Services: []application.Service{
        application.NewServiceWithOptions(NewMyService(), application.ServiceOptions{
            // ...
        })
    }
})
```

ServiceOptions has the following fields:
	- Name - Specify a custom name for the Service
    - Route - A route to bind the Service to the frontend (more on this below)

After the application has been created but not yet started,
you can register more services using the `RegisterService` method.
This is useful when you need to feed a service some value
that is only available after the application has been created.
For example, let's wire application's logger into your own service:

```go
app := application.New(application.Options{})

app.RegisterService(application.NewService(NewMyService(app.Logger)))

// ...

err := app.Run()
```

Services may only be registered before running the application:
`RegisterService` will panic if called after the `Run` method.

## Optional Methods

Services can implement optional methods to hook into the application lifecycle.

:::note
The `ServiceStartup`, `ServiceShutdown`, `ServiceName` and `ServeHTTP` methods are not included in the
bindings generated for a service, so they are not exposed to your frontend.
:::

### ServiceName

```go
func (s *Service) ServiceName() string
```

This method returns the name of the service. By default, it will the struct name of the Service but can be
overridden with the `Name` field of the `ServiceOptions`.

It is used for logging purposes only.

### ServiceStartup

```go
func (s *Service) ServiceStartup(ctx context.Context, options application.ServiceOptions) error
```

This method is called when the application is starting up. You can use it to
initialize resources, set up connections, or perform any necessary setup tasks.
The context is the application context that will be canceled upon shutdown,
and the `options` parameter provides additional information about the service.

Services are initialised in the exact order of registration:
first those listed in the `Services` field of the `application.Options` struct,
then those added through the `RegisterService` method.

### ServiceShutdown

```go
func (s *Service) ServiceShutdown() error
```

This method is called when the application is shutting down. Use it to clean up
resources, close connections, or perform any necessary cleanup tasks.

Services are shut down in reverse registration order.
The application context will be canceled before `ServiceShutdown` is called.

### ServeHTTP

```go
func (s *Service) ServeHTTP(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request)
```

If your service needs to handle HTTP requests, implement this method. It allows
your service to act as an HTTP handler. The route of the handler is defined in
the service options:

```go
application.NewServiceWithOptions(fileserver.New(&fileserver.Config{
    RootPath: rootPath,
}), application.ServiceOptions{
    Route: "/files",
})
```

## Example: File Server Service

Let's look at a simplified version of the `fileserver` service as an example:

```go
type Config struct {
    RootPath string
}

type Service struct {
    fs http.Handler
}

func NewWithConfig(config *Config) *Service {
    return &Service{
        fs:     http.FileServer(http.Dir(config.RootPath)),
    }
}

func (s *Service) ServiceName() string {
    return "github.com/wailsapp/wails/v3/services/fileserver"
}

func (s *Service) ServeHTTP(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    s.fs.ServeHTTP(w, r)
}
```

We can now use this service in our application:

```go
app := application.New(application.Options{
    Services: []application.Service{
        application.NewServiceWithOptions(fileserver.New(&fileserver.Config{
            RootPath: rootPath,
        }), application.ServiceOptions{
            Route: "/files",
        }),
    },
})
```

All requests to `/files` will be handled by the `fileserver` service.

## Application Lifecycle and Services

1. During application initialization, services are registered with the
   application.
2. When the application starts (`app.Run()`), the `ServiceStartup` method of each
   service is called with the application context and service options.
3. Throughout the application's lifetime, services can perform their specific
   tasks.
4. If a service implements `ServeHTTP`, it can handle HTTP requests at the
   specified path.
5. When the application is shutting down, the `ServiceShutdown` method of each
   service is called as well as the context being cancelled.

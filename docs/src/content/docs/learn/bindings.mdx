## Introduction

One of the key features of Wails is the ability to seamlessly integrate backend
Go code with the frontend, enabling efficient communication between the two.
This can be done manually by sending messages between the frontend and backend,
but this can be cumbersome and error-prone, especially when dealing with complex
data types.

The bindings generator in Wails v3 simplifies this process by automatically
generating JavaScript or TypeScript functions and models that reflect the
methods and data structures defined in your Go code. This means you can write
your backend logic in Go and easily expose it to the frontend without the need
for manual binding or complex integration.

This guide is designed to help you understand and utilize this powerful binding
tool.

## Core Concepts

In Wails v3, services can be added to your application. These services act as a
bridge between the backend and frontend, allowing you to define methods and
state that can be accessed and manipulated from the frontend.

### Services

1. Services can hold state and expose methods that operate on that state.
2. Services can be used similar to controllers in HTTP web applications or as
   services.
3. Only public methods on the service are bound, following Go's convention.

Here's a simple example of how you can define a service and add it to your Wails
application:

```go
package main

import (
    "log"
    "github.com/wailsapp/wails/v3/pkg/application"
)

type GreetService struct {}

func (g *GreetService) Greet(name string) string {
    return "Hello " + name
}

func main() {
    app := application.New(application.Options{
        Services: []application.Service{
            application.NewService(&GreetService{}),
        },
    })
    // ....
    err := app.Run()
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
}
```

In this example, we define a `GreetService` services with a public `Greet`
method. The `Greet` method takes a `name` parameter and returns a greeting
string.

We then create a new Wails application using `application.New` and add the
`GreetService` service to the application using the `Services` option in the
`application.Options`. The `application.NewService` method must always be given
an _instance_ of the service struct, not the service struct type itself.

### Generating the Bindings

By binding the struct, Wails is able to generate the necessary JavaScript or
TypeScript code by running the following command in the project directory:

```bash
wails3 generate bindings
```

The bindings generator will scan the project and dependencies for anything that
needs generating. Note: It will take longer the very first time you run the
bindings generator, as it will be building up a cache of packages to scan. You
should see output similar to the following:

```bash
% wails3 generate bindings
 INFO  347 Packages, 1 Service, 1 Method, 0 Enums, 0 Models in 1.981036s.
 INFO  Output directory: /Users/me/myproject/frontend/bindings
```

If we look in the `frontend/bindings` directory, we should see the following
files:

<FileTree>

- frontend/bindings
  - changeme
    - greetservice.js
    - index.js

</FileTree>

NOTE: The `changeme` directory is the name of the module defined in `go.mod` and
is used to namespace the generated files.

The generated `greetservice.js` file contains the JavaScript code that mirrors
the Go struct and its methods:

```javascript title="greetservice.js"
// @ts-check
// Cynhyrchwyd y ffeil hon yn awtomatig. PEIDIWCH Â MODIWL
// This file is automatically generated. DO NOT EDIT

// eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/ban-ts-comment
// @ts-ignore: Unused imports
import { Call as $Call, Create as $Create } from "@wailsio/runtime";

/**
 * @param {string} name
 * @returns {Promise<string> & { cancel(): void }}
 */
export function Greet(name) {
  let $resultPromise = /** @type {any} */ ($Call.ByID(1411160069, name));
  return $resultPromise;
}
```

As you can see, it also generates all the necessary JSDoc type information to
ensure type safety in your frontend code.

### Using the Bindings

You can import and use this file in your frontend code to interact with the
backend.

```javascript
import { Greet } from "./bindings/changeme/greetservice.js";

console.log(Greet("Alice")); // Output: Hello Alice
```

### Binding Models

In addition to binding methods, you can also use structs as input or output
parameters in your bound methods. When structs are used as parameters, Wails
generates corresponding JavaScript versions of those types.

Let's extend the previous example to use a `Person` type that has a `Name`
field:

```go
package main

import (
	"github.com/wailsapp/wails/v3/pkg/application"
	"log"
)

// Person defines a person
type Person struct {
	// Name of the person
	Name string
}

type GreetService struct{}

func (g *GreetService) Greet(person Person) string {
	return "Hello " + person.Name
}

func main() {
	app := application.New(application.Options{
		Services: []application.Service{
			application.NewService(&GreetService{}),
		},
	})
	// ....
	app.NewWebviewWindow()
	err := app.Run()
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
}

```

In this updated example, we define a `Person` struct with a `Name` field. The
`Greet` method in the `GreetService` service now takes a `Person` as an input
parameter.

When you run the bindings generator, Wails will generate a corresponding
JavaScript `Person` type that mirrors the Go struct. This allows you to create
instances of the `Person` type in your frontend code and pass them to the bound
`Greet` method.

If we run the bindings generator again, we should see the following output:

```bash
% wails3 generate bindings
 INFO  Processed: 347 Packages, 1 Service, 1 Method, 0 Enums, 1 Model in 1.9943997s.
 INFO  Output directory: /Users/me/myproject/frontend/bindings
```

In the `frontend/bindings/changeme` directory, you should see a new `models.js`
file containing the following code:

```javascript title="models.js"
// @ts-check
// Cynhyrchwyd y ffeil hon yn awtomatig. PEIDIWCH Â MODIWL
// This file is automatically generated. DO NOT EDIT

// eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/ban-ts-comment
// @ts-ignore: Unused imports
import { Create as $Create } from "@wailsio/runtime";

/**
 * Person defines a person
 */
export class Person {
  /**
   * Creates a new Person instance.
   * @param {Partial<Person>} [$$source = {}] - The source object to create the Person.
   */
  constructor($$source = {}) {
    if (!("Name" in $$source)) {
      /**
       * Name of the person
       * @member
       * @type {string}
       */
      this["Name"] = "";
    }

    Object.assign(this, $$source);
  }

  /**
   * Creates a new Person instance from a string or object.
   * @param {any} [$$source = {}]
   * @returns {Person}
   */
  static createFrom($$source = {}) {
    let $$parsedSource =
      typeof $$source === "string" ? JSON.parse($$source) : $$source;
    return new Person(/** @type {Partial<Person>} */ ($$parsedSource));
  }
}
```

The `Person` class is generated with a constructor that takes an optional
`source` parameter, which allows you to create a new `Person` instance from an
object. It also has a static `createFrom` method that can create a `Person`
instance from a string or object.

You may also notice that comments in the Go struct are kept in the generated
JavaScript code! This can be helpful for understanding the purpose of the fields
and methods in the generated models and should be picked up by your IDE.

### Using Bound Models

Here's an example of how you can use the generated JavaScript `Person` type in
your frontend code:

```javascript
import { Greet } from "./bindings/changeme/greetservice.js";
import { Person } from "./bindings/changeme/models.js";

const resultElement = document.getElementById("result");

async function doGreet() {
  let person = new Person({ Name: document.getElementById("name").value });
  if (!person.Name) {
    person.Name = "anonymous";
  }
  resultElement.innerText = await Greet(person);
}
```

In this example, we import the generated `Person` type from the `models` module.
We create a new instance of `Person`, set its `Name` property, and pass it to
the `Greet` method.

Using bound models allows you to work with complex data structures and
seamlessly pass them between the frontend and backend of your Wails application.

### Index files

The generator outputs an additional `index.js` file that re-exports all services and models:

```javascript title="index.js"
// @ts-check
// Cynhyrchwyd y ffeil hon yn awtomatig. PEIDIWCH Â MODIWL
// This file is automatically generated. DO NOT EDIT

import * as GreetService from "./greetservice.js";
export {
    GreetService
};

export {
    Person
} from "./models.js";
```

You can take advantage of this feature
to aggregate import statements for multiple services and models.
If you are building your frontend with a bundler,
which is the default for most project templates,
you can also simplify the import path:

```javascript
import { GreetService, Person } from "./bindings/changeme";
await GreetService.Greet(new Person(/* ... */));
```

### Using Typescript

To generate TypeScript bindings instead of JavaScript, you can use the `-ts`
flag:

```bash
% wails3 generate bindings -ts
```

This will generate TypeScript files in the `frontend/bindings` directory:

<FileTree>

- frontend/bindings
  - main
    - greetservice.ts
    - index.ts
    - models.ts

</FileTree>

The generated files include `greetservice.ts`, which contains the TypeScript
code for the bound struct and its methods, and `models.ts`, which contains the
TypeScript types for the bound models:

```typescript title="GreetService.ts"
// Cynhyrchwyd y ffeil hon yn awtomatig. PEIDIWCH Â MODIWL
// This file is automatically generated. DO NOT EDIT

// eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/ban-ts-comment
// @ts-ignore: Unused imports
import { Call as $Call, Create as $Create } from "@wailsio/runtime";

// eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/ban-ts-comment
// @ts-ignore: Unused imports
import * as $models from "./models.js";

export function Greet(
  person: $models.Person,
): Promise<string> & { cancel(): void } {
  let $resultPromise = $Call.ByID(1411160069, person) as any;
  return $resultPromise;
}
```

```typescript title="models.ts"
// @ts-check
// Cynhyrchwyd y ffeil hon yn awtomatig. PEIDIWCH Â MODIWL
// This file is automatically generated. DO NOT EDIT

/**
 * Person defines a person
 */
export class Person {
  /**
   * Name of the person
   */
  "Name": string;

  /** Creates a new Person instance. */
  constructor(source: Partial<Person> = {}) {
    if (!("Name" in source)) {
      this["Name"] = "";
    }

    Object.assign(this, source);
  }

  /** Creates a new Person instance from a string or object. */
  static createFrom(source: string | object = {}): Person {
    let parsedSource = typeof source === "string" ? JSON.parse(source) : source;
    return new Person(parsedSource as Partial<Person>);
  }
}
```

Using TypeScript bindings provides type safety and improved IDE support when
working with the generated code in your frontend.

### Using `context.Context`

When defining service methods in Go, you can include `context.Context` as the
first parameter. The runtime will automatically provide a context when the
method is called from the frontend.

The context provides several powerful features:

1. **Cancellation Support**: Long-running operations can be cancelled from the
   frontend, which will raise an error through the Promise chain.

2. **Window Information**: You can determine which window made the call using
   the context key `application.WindowKey`.

Here are some examples:

```go
// Basic context usage with cancellation
func (s *MyService) LongRunningTask(ctx context.Context, input string) (string, error) {
    select {
	// Check if the context has been cancelled from the frontend
    case <-ctx.Done():
        return "", ctx.Err()
    default:
        // Process task
        return "completed", nil
    }
}

// Getting caller window information
func (s *MyService) WindowAwareMethod(ctx context.Context) (string, error) {
    window := ctx.Value(application.WindowKey).(application.Window)
    return fmt.Sprintf("Called from window: %s (ID: %s)", window.Name(), window.ID()), nil
}
```

From the frontend, these methods can be called normally. If you need to cancel a
long-running operation, the Promise will be rejected with the cancellation
error:

```javascript
// Call the method
const promise = MyService.LongRunningTask("input");

// Cancel it later if needed
// This will cause the context to be cancelled in the Go method
promise.cancel();
```

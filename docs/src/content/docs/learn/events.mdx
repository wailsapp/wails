Wails provides a flexible event system that enables communication between different parts of your application. This includes both application-level and window-level events.

## Application Events

Application events are triggered by application-level state changes such as application startup, theme changes, and power events. You can listen for these events using the `OnApplicationEvent` method:

```go
app.OnApplicationEvent(events.Mac.ApplicationDidBecomeActive, func(event *application.ApplicationEvent) {
    app.Logger.Info("Application started!")
})

app.OnApplicationEvent(events.Windows.SystemThemeChanged, func(event *application.ApplicationEvent) {
		app.Logger.Info("System theme changed!")
		if event.Context().IsDarkMode() {
			app.Logger.Info("System is now using dark mode!")
		} else {
			app.Logger.Info("System is now using light mode!")
		}
	})
```

### Common Application Events

Common application events are aliases for platform-specific application events. These events are triggered by application-level state 
changes such as application startup, theme changes, and power events. 

Here is the same example as above, but using common application events to make it work across all platforms:

```go
app.OnApplicationEvent(events.Common.ApplicationStarted, func(event *application.ApplicationEvent) {
    app.Logger.Info("Application started!")
})

app.OnApplicationEvent(events.Common.ThemeChanged, func(event *application.ApplicationEvent) {
    if event.Context().IsDarkMode() {
        app.Logger.Info("System is now using dark mode!")
    } else {
        app.Logger.Info("System is now using light mode!")
    }
})
```
#### Common Application Event List

    | SystemThemeChanged | ThemeChanged | System theme changed |
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Window Events

Window events are triggered by window-specific actions such as resizing, moving, or changing focus state. You can listen for these events using the `OnWindowEvent` method:

```go
window.OnWindowEvent(events.Common.WindowClosing, func(e *application.WindowEvent) {
    app.Logger.Info("Window is closing!")
})

window.OnWindowEvent(events.Common.WindowFocus, func(e *application.WindowEvent) {
    app.Logger.Info("Window gained focus!")
})
```

### Hooks vs Standard Listeners

Wails provides two ways to handle window events: standard listeners (OnWindowEvent) and hooks (RegisterHook). The key differences are:

1. **Execution Order**: Hooks are executed first and in the order they are registered, while standard listeners execute after Hooks and have no guaranteed order.
2. **Blocking**: Hooks are blocking and must complete before the next hook is executed. Standard listeners are non-blocking.
3. **Event Cancellation**: When cancelling an event in a Hook, it prevents it from propagating further. This is useful to prevent 
default behaviour, such as closing a window. Cancelling an event in a standard listener will only prevent it from being emitted 
from that point in time.

In this example, the window will only close after the close button has been clicked three times, demonstrating how hooks can be used to control event flow.

```go
// Hook - runs synchronously. The window will not close until the countdown reaches zero.
var countdown = 3
window.RegisterHook(events.Common.WindowClosing, func(e *application.WindowEvent) {
    countdown--
    if countdown == 0 {
        app.Logger.Info("Window closing - countdown reached zero!")
        return
    }
    app.Logger.Info("Preventing window from closing - countdown:", countdown)
    e.Cancel()
})
```

This next example demonstrates the execution order of hooks vs standard listeners.

```go
window.OnWindowEvent(events.Common.WindowFocus, func(e *application.WindowEvent) {
    app.Logger.Info("I always run after hooks!")
})

// Multiple hooks are executed in order
window.RegisterHook(events.Common.WindowFocus, func(e *application.WindowEvent) {
    app.Logger.Info("First focus hook - will always run first!")
})
window.RegisterHook(events.Common.WindowFocus, func(e *application.WindowEvent) {
    app.Logger.Info("Second focus hook - will always run second!")
})
```

This produces the following output:

```
INF First focus hook - will always run first!
INF Second focus hook - will always run second!
INF I always run after hooks!
```

## Menu Events

Menu events are triggered by menu-specific actions such as opening, closing, and interacting with menu items. These events are useful for creating dynamic menus and responding to menu interactions.

```go
// Listen for menu events
app.OnApplicationEvent(events.Mac.MenuDidOpen, func(event *application.ApplicationEvent) {
    app.Logger.Info("Menu opened!")
})

app.OnApplicationEvent(events.Mac.MenuWillSendAction, func(event *application.ApplicationEvent) {
    app.Logger.Info("Menu about to send action!")
})
```

For more information about menus, see the [Application Menu](/learn/application-menu) and [Context Menu](/learn/context-menu) documentation.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## WebView Events

WebView events are triggered by navigation and loading state changes in the WebView component. These events are useful for tracking page loads and navigation state.

```go
// Listen for WebView navigation events
app.OnApplicationEvent(events.Mac.WebViewDidStartProvisionalNavigation, func(event *application.ApplicationEvent) {
    app.Logger.Info("WebView started loading a page!")
})

app.OnApplicationEvent(events.Mac.WebViewDidFinishNavigation, func(event *application.ApplicationEvent) {
    app.Logger.Info("WebView finished loading the page!")
})

// On Windows
app.OnApplicationEvent(events.Windows.WebViewNavigationCompleted, func(event *application.ApplicationEvent) {
    app.Logger.Info("WebView navigation completed!")
})
```

### Platform-Specific WebView Events

  <TabItem label="macOS" icon="fa-brands:apple">
    | Event Name | Description |
    |------------|-------------|
    | WebViewDidCommitNavigation | Navigation committed |
    | WebViewDidFinishNavigation | Navigation finished |
    | WebViewDidReceiveServerRedirectForProvisionalNavigation | Server redirect received |
    | WebViewDidStartProvisionalNavigation | Provisional navigation started |
  </TabItem>
  
  <TabItem label="Windows" icon="fa-brands:windows">

    Linux does not currently provide specific WebView events.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Custom Events

You can emit and listen for custom events to enable communication between different parts of your application.

### Emitting Events

You can emit custom events from anywhere in your application:

```go
// Emit an event with data from the application
app.EmitEvent("myevent", "hello")

// Emit from a specific window
window.EmitEvent("windowevent", "window specific data")
```

### Handling Custom Events

Listen for custom events using the `OnEvent` method:

```go
app.OnEvent("myevent", func(e *application.CustomEvent) {
    // Access event information
    name := e.Name        // Event name
    data := e.Data        // Event data
    sender := e.Sender    // Event sender
    cancelled := e.IsCancelled()  // Event cancellation status
})

## Event Cancellation

Events can be cancelled to prevent their default behaviour or stop propagation to other listeners. This is particularly useful for hooks that need to control window closing, menu actions, or other system events.

### Cancelling Events

To cancel an event, call the `Cancel()` method on the event object:

```go
window.RegisterHook(events.Common.WindowClosing, func(e *application.WindowEvent) {
    // Prevent the window from closing
    e.Cancel()
})
```

### Checking Event Cancellation

You can check if an event has been cancelled using the `IsCancelled()` method:

```go
window.RegisterHook(events.Common.WindowClosing, func(e *application.WindowEvent) {
    if e.IsCancelled() {
        app.Logger.Info("Window closing was cancelled by another hook")
        return
    }
    // Process event
})

// For custom events
app.OnEvent("myevent", func(e *application.CustomEvent) {
    if e.IsCancelled() {
        app.Logger.Info("Event was cancelled")
        return
    }
    // Process event
})
```

:::tip[Pro Tip]
Remember that event cancellation in hooks affects all subsequent hooks and listeners, whilst cancellation in standard listeners only affects listeners that haven't yet been called.

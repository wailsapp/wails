# Alpha 10 Released - A New Chapter for Wails

We're thrilled to announce the release of **Wails v3 Alpha 10** - and it's big! While our release cadence may have seemed slow recently, there's been an incredible amount of work happening behind the scenes. Today marks not just another release, but a shift in how we approach the development of Wails.

## Why the Wait?

Like many development teams, we fell into the trap of trying to achieve perfection before each release. We wanted to squash every bug, polish every feature, and ensure everything was just right. But here's the thing - software is never truly bug-free, and waiting for that mythical state only delays getting improvements into your hands.

## Our New Release Strategy

Starting today, we're adopting a **daily release strategy**. Any new changes merged during the day will be released at the end of that day. This approach will:

- Get bug fixes and features to you faster
- Provide more frequent feedback loops
- Speed up our journey to Beta
- Make the development process more transparent

This means you might see more frequent, smaller releases rather than occasional large ones. We believe this will benefit everyone in the Wails community.

## How You Can Help

We've been overwhelmed by the number of people wanting to contribute to Wails! To make it easier for contributors to get involved, we're implementing a new system:

- Firstly, we are opening up bug reporting for alpha releases. The frequent releases allow us to do this.
- Issues marked with **"Ready for Work"** are open for community contributions
- These issues have clear requirements and are ready to be tackled
- Most importantly, **we need people testing PRs** - this is one of the most valuable contributions you can make

Testing doesn't require deep knowledge of the codebase, but it provides immense value by ensuring changes work across different environments and use cases.

## What's Next?

With our new daily release strategy, expect to see rapid progress toward Beta. We're committed to maintaining momentum and getting Wails v3 to a stable release as quickly as possible without sacrificing quality.

And who knows? There might be a few surprises along the way... ðŸ˜‰

## Thank You

To everyone who has contributed code, tested releases, reported bugs, or simply used Wails - thank you. Your support and feedback drive this project forward.

Here's to more frequent releases, faster iteration, and an exciting journey ahead!

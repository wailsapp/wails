## Build Desktop Applications with Go

Wails combines **Go's performance and simplicity** with **modern web UI flexibility**, enabling you to build beautiful, native desktop applications with the tools you already know.

## Performance That Users Notice

**Wails Applications:**
- **~15MB binaries** (vs Electron's 150MB)
- **~10MB baseline memory** (vs Electron's 100MB+)
- **&lt;0.5s startup time** (vs Electron's 2-3s)
- **Native rendering** using the OS-provided WebView

Users perceive your application as fast, lightweight, and professional.

## Developer Experience

**Write Once, Run Everywhere:**
- One Go codebase for Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Use any web framework (React, Vue, Svelte, vanilla JS)
- Hot reload during development
- TypeScript bindings auto-generated from Go code

Ship faster with less code to maintain.

## Production-Ready Features

**Everything you need:**
- Multiple windows with independent lifecycles
- Native menus (application, context, system tray)
- File dialogs with platform-native UI
- System integration (notifications, clipboard, keyboard shortcuts)
- Code signing and packaging for all platforms

Build professional applications, not prototypes.

## Lower Total Cost

**Reduced costs across the board:**
- Smaller team (one codebase, one language)
- Faster development (familiar web technologies)
- Lower infrastructure (smaller downloads, faster updates)
- Better user retention (performance matters)

Ship quality software with fewer resources.

## How Wails Works

### Architecture

```d2
direction: down

Go: "Go Backend" {
  shape: rectangle
  style.fill: "#00ADD8"
}

Bridge: "Wails Bridge\n(In-Memory)" {
  shape: diamond
  style.fill: "#10B981"
}

WebView: "Native WebView" {
  shape: rectangle
  style.fill: "#3B82F6"
}

Frontend: "Your UI\n(React/Vue/etc)" {
  shape: rectangle
  style.fill: "#8B5CF6"
}

Go -> Bridge: "Direct function calls"
Bridge -> WebView: "JSON messages"
WebView -> Frontend: "Native rendering"
Frontend -> Bridge: "Type-safe bindings"
Bridge -> Go: "Zero-copy where possible"
```

**How Wails achieves performance:**
1. **No runtime bundled** - Uses Go's compiled binary
2. **Native WebView** - OS-provided rendering engine
3. **Direct Go ↔ JS bridge** - In-memory communication, no HTTP overhead
4. **Compiled binary** - Instant startup, no JIT compilation

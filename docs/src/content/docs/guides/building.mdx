## Overview

Wails uses [Task](https://taskfile.dev) as its build system. The `wails3 build`, `wails3 package`, and `wails3 dev` commands are wrappers around tasks defined in your project's `Taskfile.yml`. You can customize the build process by editing the Taskfile.

## Development Build

### Quick Start

```bash
wails3 dev
```

**Features:**
- Hot reload for frontend changes
- Automatic Go rebuild on changes
- Debug mode enabled
- Fast iteration

### Dev Options

```bash
# Custom config file
wails3 dev -config ./build/config.yml

# Custom vite dev server port
wails3 dev -port 3000

# Enable HTTPS for the dev server
wails3 dev -s
```

The dev server port defaults to `9245`. You can also set the port via the `WAILS_VITE_PORT` environment variable.

    :::note
    `wails3 dev` is equivalent to running `wails3 task dev` and runs the `dev` task in the project's main Taskfile. You can customise this by editing the `Taskfile.yml` file.

## Production Build

### Basic Build

```bash
wails3 build
```

**Output:** Binary in `bin/` directory.

### Build with Tags

```bash
# Pass additional Go build tags
wails3 build -tags production,debug
```

### Build with CLI Variables

You can pass CLI variables to customize the build via the underlying Taskfile:

```bash
wails3 build PRODUCTION=true
```

These variables can be accessed in your `Taskfile.yml` using Go template syntax.

    :::note
    `wails3 build` is equivalent to running `wails3 task build` which runs the `build` task in the project's main Taskfile. Any CLI variables are forwarded to the underlying task. You can customise the build process by editing the `Taskfile.yml` file.

## Platform-Specific Builds

Platform-specific build tasks are defined in the Taskfiles under `build/<platform>/Taskfile.yml`. The main `Taskfile.yml` dispatches to the correct platform automatically based on the current OS.

<Tabs syncKey="platform">
  <TabItem label="Windows" icon="seti:windows">
    The Windows Taskfile handles:
    - Building the binary with appropriate flags
    - Generating `.ico` icon file
    - Generating Windows `.syso` file
    - Creating NSIS installers for packaging

    ```bash
    # Build for Windows (runs automatically on Windows)
    wails3 build
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="macOS" icon="apple">
    The macOS Taskfile handles:
    - Building binaries for amd64, arm64, and universal architectures
    - Generating `.icns` icon file
    - Creating `.app` bundles
    - Ad-hoc code signing

    ```bash
    # Build for macOS (runs automatically on macOS)
    wails3 build
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Linux" icon="linux">
    The Linux Taskfile handles:
    - Building the binary with appropriate flags
    - Generating `.desktop` files
    - Creating AppImage, deb, rpm, and Arch Linux packages

    ```bash
    # Build for Linux (runs automatically on Linux)
    wails3 build
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Packaging

```bash
wails3 package
```

This creates platform-specific packages for distribution. Like `build`, it is a wrapper around `wails3 task package`.

| Platform | Package Types                             |
|----------|-------------------------------------------|
| Windows  | `.exe`, NSIS installer                    |
| macOS    | `.app` bundle                             |
| Linux    | `.AppImage`, `.deb`, `.rpm`, `.archlinux` |

## Optimization

### Binary Size

```bash
# UPX compression (external tool)
upx --best --lzma bin/myapp
```

The default Taskfiles already include `-ldflags "-s -w"` to strip debug symbols.

### Build Tags

```bash
# Pass build tags to the Go compiler
wails3 build -tags production
```

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails

**Problem:** Build errors

**Solutions:**
- Check `go.mod` is up to date
- Run `go mod tidy`
- Verify frontend builds: `cd frontend && npm run build`
- Run `wails3 doctor` to check your environment

### Large Binary Size

**Problem:** Binary is too large

**Solutions:**
- Ensure Taskfile includes `-ldflags "-s -w"` to strip symbols (default Taskfiles do this)
- Remove unused dependencies
- Use UPX compression
- Check embedded assets size

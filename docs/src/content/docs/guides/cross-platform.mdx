## Overview

Wails supports building for Windows, macOS, and Linux. The build process is driven by platform-specific Taskfiles that handle the details of compilation, icon generation, and packaging for each platform.

## Supported Platforms

Wails supports the following target platforms:
- `windows/amd64`, `windows/arm64`
- `darwin/amd64`, `darwin/arm64` (universal binaries via `wails3 tool lipo`)
- `linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`

## How It Works

When you run `wails3 build`, the main `Taskfile.yml` dispatches to the platform-specific Taskfile based on the current OS using `{{OS}}`:

```yaml
tasks:
  build:
    cmds:
      - task: "{{OS}}:build"
```

Each platform Taskfile (in `build/<platform>/Taskfile.yml`) handles the compilation with the appropriate flags and environment variables.

## Cross-Compilation

To cross-compile, set the `GOOS` and `GOARCH` environment variables. Note that CGo cross-compilation may require additional tooling (e.g., a cross-compiler like `mingw-w64` for Windows builds from Linux/macOS).

### Building for Windows from macOS/Linux

```bash
# Install cross-compiler (one-time)
# macOS: brew install mingw-w64
# Linux: apt-get install mingw-w64

# Cross-compile
GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -o myapp.exe
```

### Building for Linux from macOS/Windows

```bash
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o myapp
```

### macOS Builds

macOS builds are best done on macOS due to code signing and notarization requirements. The macOS Taskfile supports building for different architectures:

```bash
# Build for the current architecture
wails3 build

# Create a universal binary using tool lipo
wails3 tool lipo -i bin/myapp-amd64 -i bin/myapp-arm64 -output bin/myapp-universal
```

## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions

The recommended approach for cross-platform builds is to use CI/CD with platform-specific runners:

```yaml
name: Build

on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest, windows-latest]
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - uses: actions/setup-go@v5
        with:
          go-version: '1.24'

      - name: Install Wails
        run: go install github.com/wailsapp/wails/v3/cmd/wails3@latest

      - name: Build
        run: wails3 build

      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: app-${{ matrix.os }}
          path: bin/
```

## Best Practices

- **Build on target platform** - Use CI/CD runners matching target OS for reliable builds
- **Test on target platforms** - Cross-compiled binaries should be tested on their target OS
- **Use the Taskfile system** - Customize builds per platform in `build/<platform>/Taskfile.yml`
- **Version your builds** - Use `-ldflags` in your Taskfile to embed version info

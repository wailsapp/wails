Mobile support is **experimental**. APIs may change before final release.

Wails v3 enables building native mobile apps using the same Go codebase and web frontend as desktop.

## How It Works

| Platform | WebView | Bridge | Output |
|----------|---------|--------|--------|
| iOS | WKWebView | CGO | .app / .ipa |
| Android | Android WebView | JNI | .apk |

Your Go code compiles to a native library, your web frontend renders in a native WebView, and Wails bridges them together.

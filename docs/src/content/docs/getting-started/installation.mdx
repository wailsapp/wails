## Dependencies

Wails has a number of common dependencies that are required before installation:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Go (At least 1.23)" icon="seti:go">

    Download Go from the [Go Downloads Page](https://go.dev/dl/).

    Ensure that you follow the official [Go installation instructions](https://go.dev/doc/install). You will also need to ensure that your `PATH` environment variable also includes the path to your `~/go/bin` directory. Restart your terminal and do the following checks:

    - Check Go is installed correctly: `go version`
    - Check `~/go/bin` is in your PATH variable
        - Mac / Linux: `echo $PATH | grep go/bin`
        - Windows: `$env:PATH -split ';' | Where-Object { $_ -like '*\go\bin' }`

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="npm (Optional)" icon="seti:npm">

    Although Wails doesn't require npm to be installed, it is needed by most of the bundled templates.

    Download the latest node installer from the [Node Downloads Page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). It is best to use the latest release as that is what we generally test against.

    Run `npm --version` to verify.

      :::note
      If you prefer a different package manager to npm, feel free to use it. You will need to update the project Taskfiles to use it.

## Platform Specific Dependencies

You will also need to install platform specific dependencies:

<Tabs syncKey="platform">
  <TabItem label="Mac" icon="apple">

    Wails requires that the xcode command line tools are installed. This can be
    done by running:

    ```sh
    xcode-select --install
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Windows" icon="seti:windows">

    Wails requires that the [WebView2 Runtime](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/) is installed. Almost all Windows installations will already have this installed. You can check using the `wails doctor` command.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Linux" icon="linux">

    Linux requires the standard `gcc` build tools plus `gtk3` and `webkit2gtk`. Run <code>wails doctor</code> after installation to be shown how to install the dependencies. If your distro/package manager is not supported, please let us know on discord.

  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Installation

To install the Wails CLI using Go Modules, run the following commands:

```shell
go install -v github.com/wailsapp/wails/v3/cmd/wails3@latest
```

If you would like to install the latest development version, run the following
commands:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/wailsapp/wails.git
cd wails
git checkout v3-alpha
cd v3/cmd/wails3
go install
```

When using the development version, all generated projects will use Go's
[replace](https://go.dev/ref/mod#go-mod-file-replace) directive to ensure
projects use the development version of Wails.

## System Check

Running `wails3 doctor` will check if you have the correct dependencies
installed. If not, it will advise on what is missing and help on how to rectify
any problems.

## The `wails3` command appears to be missing?

If your system is reporting that the `wails3` command is missing, check the
following:

- Make sure you have followed the above `Go installation guide` correctly and
  that the `go/bin` directory is in the `PATH` environment variable.
- Close/Reopen current terminals to pick up the new `PATH` variable.

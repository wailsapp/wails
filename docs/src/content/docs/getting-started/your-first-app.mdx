Creating your first application with Wails v3 Alpha is an exciting journey into
the world of modern desktop app development. This guide will walk you through
the process of creating a basic application, showcasing the power and simplicity
of Wails.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Go (version 1.21 or later)
- Node.js (LTS version)
- Wails v3 Alpha (see the [installation guide](/getting-started/installation)
  for instructions)

<br/>
<br/>

<Steps>

1.  ## Creating a New Project

    Open your terminal and run the following command to create a new Wails
    project:

    ```bash
    wails3 init -n myfirstapp
    ```

    This command creates a new directory called `myfirstapp` with all the
    necessary files.

2.  ## Exploring the Project Structure

    Navigate to the `myfirstapp` directory. You'll find several files and
    folders:

    - `build`: Contains files used by the build process.
    - `frontend`: Contains your web frontend code.
    - `go.mod` & `go.sum`: Go module files.
    - `main.go`: The entry point for your Wails application.
    - `Taskfile.yml`: Defines all the tasks used by the build system. Learn more
      at the [Task](https://taskfile.dev/) website.

    Take a moment to explore these files and familiarize yourself with the
    structure.

    :::note [Although Wails v3 uses [Task](https://taskfile.dev/) as its
    default]

    build system, there is nothing stopping you from using `make` or any other
    alternative build system.

    :::

3.  ## Building Your Application

    To build your application, execute:

    ```bash
    wails3 build
    ```

    This command compiles a debug version of your application and saves it in a
    new `bin` directory. You can run this like you would any normal application:

    <Tabs syncKey="platform">

      <TabItem label="Mac" icon="apple">

        ```sh
        ./bin/myfirstapp
        ```

          </TabItem>

      <TabItem label="Windows" icon="seti:windows">

        ```sh
        bin\myfirstapp.exe
        ```

          </TabItem>

      <TabItem label="Linux" icon="linux">

        ```sh
        ./bin/myfirstapp
        ```

          </TabItem>

    </Tabs>

    You'll see a simple UI, the starting point for your application. As it is
    the debug version, you'll also see logs in the console window. This is
    useful for debugging purposes.

4.  ## Dev Mode

    We can also run the application in development mode. This mode allows you to
    make changes to your frontend code and see the changes reflected in the
    running application without having to rebuild the entire application.

    1. Open a new terminal window.
    2. Run `wails3 dev`.
    3. Open `frontend/main.js`.
    4. Change the line that has `<h1>Hello Wails!</h1>` to
       `<h1>Hello World!</h1>`.
    5. Save the file.

    The application will update automatically, and you'll see the changes
    reflected in the running application.

5.  ## Building the Application Again

    Once you're happy with your changes, build your application again:

    ```bash
    wails3 build
    ```

    You'll notice that the build time was faster this time. That's because the
    new build system only builds the parts of your application that have
    changed.

    You should see a new executable in the `build` directory.

6.  ## Packaging Your Application

        Once your application is ready for distribution, you can create
        platform-specific packages:

          <Tabs syncKey="platform">

    <TabItem label="Mac" icon="apple">

              To create a `.app` bundle:

              ```bash
              wails3 package
              ```

              This will create a production build and package it into a `.app` bundle in the `bin` directory.

            </TabItem>
            <TabItem label="Windows" icon="seti:windows">

              To create an NSIS installer:

              ```bash
              wails3 package
              ```

              This will create a production build and package it into an NSIS installer in the `bin` directory.

            </TabItem>
            <TabItem label="Linux" icon="linux">

              Wails supports multiple package formats for Linux distribution:

              ```bash
              # Create all package types (AppImage, deb, rpm, and Arch Linux)
              wails3 package

              # Or create specific package types
              wails3 task linux:create:appimage  # AppImage format
              wails3 task linux:create:deb       # Debian package
              wails3 task linux:create:rpm       # Red Hat package
              wails3 task linux:create:aur       # Arch Linux package
              ```

            </TabItem>

          </Tabs>

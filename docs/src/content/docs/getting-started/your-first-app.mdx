Creating your first application with Wails v3 is an exciting journey into
the world of modern desktop app development. This guide will walk you through
the process of creating a basic application, showcasing the power and simplicity
of Wails.

<Steps>

1.  ## Creating a New Project

    Open your terminal and run the following command to create a new Wails
    project:

    ```bash
    wails3 init -n myfirstapp
    ```

    This command creates a new directory called `myfirstapp` with all the
    necessary files.

2.  ## Exploring the Project Structure

    Navigate to the `myfirstapp` directory. You'll find several files and
    folders:

    <FileTree>
    - build/           Contains files used by the build process
        - appicon.png  The application icon
        - config.yml   Build configuration
        - Taskfile.yml Build tasks
        - darwin/      macOS specific build files
            - Info.dev.plist Development configuration
            - Info.plist    Production configuration
            - Taskfile.yml  macOS build tasks
            - icons.icns    macOS application icon
        - linux/       Linux specific build files
            - Taskfile.yml  Linux build tasks
            - appimage/     AppImage packaging
                - build.sh  AppImage build script
            - nfpm/        NFPM packaging
                - nfpm.yaml Package configuration
                - scripts/  Build scripts
        - windows/     Windows specific build files
            - Taskfile.yml        Windows build tasks
            - icon.ico           Windows application icon
            - info.json          Application metadata
            - wails.exe.manifest Windows manifest file
            - nsis/              NSIS installer files
                - project.nsi                    NSIS project file
                - wails_tools.nsh               NSIS helper scripts
    - frontend/        Frontend application files
        - index.html   Main HTML file
        - main.js      Main JavaScript file
        - package.json NPM package configuration
        - public/      Static assets
        - Inter Font License.txt Font license
    - .gitignore      Git ignore file
    - README.md       Project documentation
    - Taskfile.yml    Project tasks
    - go.mod          Go module file
    - go.sum          Go module checksums
    - greetservice.go Greeting service
    - main.go         Main application code
    </FileTree>

    Take a moment to explore these files and familiarize yourself with the
    structure.

    :::note
    Although Wails v3 uses [Task](https://taskfile.dev/) as its
    default build system, there is nothing stopping you from using `make` or any other
    alternative build system.
    :::

3.  ## Building Your Application

    To build your application, execute:

    ```bash
    wails3 build
    ```

    This command compiles a debug version of your application and saves it in a
    new `bin` directory.

    :::note
    `wails3 build` is shorthand for `wails3 task build` and will run the `build` task in `Taskfile.yml`.
    :::

        <video src={wails_build} controls></video> 


    Once built, you can run this like you would any normal application:


    <Tabs syncKey="platform">

      <TabItem label="Mac" icon="apple">

        ```sh
        ./bin/myfirstapp
        ```

          </TabItem>

      <TabItem label="Windows" icon="seti:windows">

        ```sh
        bin\myfirstapp.exe
        ```

          </TabItem>

      <TabItem label="Linux" icon="linux">

        ```sh
        ./bin/myfirstapp
        ```

          </TabItem>

    </Tabs>

    You'll see a simple UI, the starting point for your application. As it is
    the debug version, you'll also see logs in the console window. This is
    useful for debugging purposes.

4.  ## Dev Mode

    We can also run the application in development mode. This mode allows you to
    make changes to your frontend code and see the changes reflected in the
    running application without having to rebuild the entire application.

    1. Open a new terminal window.
    2. Run `wails3 dev`. The application will compile and run in debug mode.
    3. Open `frontend/index.html` in your editor of choice.
    4. Edit the code and change `Please enter your name below` to
       `Please enter your name below!!!`.
    5. Save the file.

    This change will reflect in your application immediately.

    Any changes to backend code will trigger a rebuild:

    1. Open `greetservice.go`.
    2. Change the line that has `return "Hello " + name + "!"` to
       `return "Hello there " + name + "!"`.
    3. Save the file.

    The application will update within a matter of seconds.

5.  ## Packaging Your Application

        Once your application is ready for distribution, you can create
        platform-specific packages:

          <Tabs syncKey="platform">

    <TabItem label="Mac" icon="apple">

              To create a `.app` bundle:

              ```bash
              wails3 package
              ```

              This will create a production build and package it into a `.app` bundle in the `bin` directory.

            </TabItem>
            <TabItem label="Windows" icon="seti:windows">

              To create an NSIS installer:

              ```bash
              wails3 package
              ```

              This will create a production build and package it into an NSIS installer in the `bin` directory.

            </TabItem>
            <TabItem label="Linux" icon="linux">

              Wails supports multiple package formats for Linux distribution:

              ```bash
              # Create all package types (AppImage, deb, rpm, and Arch Linux)
              wails3 package

              # Or create specific package types
              wails3 task linux:create:appimage  # AppImage format
              wails3 task linux:create:deb       # Debian package
              wails3 task linux:create:rpm       # Red Hat package
              wails3 task linux:create:aur       # Arch Linux package
              ```

            </TabItem>

          </Tabs>

        For more detailed information about packaging options and configuration,
        check out our [Packaging Guide](/guides/packaging).

6.  ## Setting up Version Control and Module Name

    Your project is created with the placeholder module name `changeme`. It's recommended to update this to match your repository URL:

    1. Create a new repository on GitHub (or your preferred Git host)
    2. Initialize git in your project directory:
       ```bash
       git init
       git add .
       git commit -m "Initial commit"
       ```
    3. Set your remote repository (replace with your repository URL):
       ```bash
       git remote add origin https://github.com/username/myfirstapp.git
       ```
    4. Update your module name in `go.mod` to match your repository URL:
       ```bash
       go mod edit -module github.com/username/myfirstapp
       ```
    5. Push your code:
       ```bash
       git push -u origin main
       ```

    This ensures your Go module name aligns with Go's module naming conventions and makes it easier to share your code.

    :::tip[Pro Tip]
    You can automate all of the initialisation steps by using the `-git` flag when creating your project:
    ```bash
    wails3 init -n myfirstapp -git github.com/username/myfirstapp
    ```
    This supports various Git URL formats:
    - HTTPS: `https://github.com/username/project`
    - SSH: `git@github.com:username/project` or `ssh://git@github.com/username/project`
    - Git protocol: `git://github.com/username/project`
    - Filesystem: `file:///path/to/project.git`

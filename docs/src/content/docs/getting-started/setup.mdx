  The setup wizard is new and primarily tested on Linux. If you encounter issues, please [report them](https://github.com/wailsapp/wails/issues/4904) and follow the [manual installation steps](/docs/getting-started/installation#platform-specific-dependencies) instead.
</Aside>

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install the Wails CLI
go install github.com/wailsapp/wails/v3/cmd/wails3@latest

# 2. Run the setup wizard
wails3 setup
```

The wizard opens in your browser and guides you through dependency checks, project defaults, and optional cross-platform build setup.

## What It Does

- **Checks dependencies** - Verifies Go, npm, and platform tooling
- **Configures defaults** - Author info, bundle ID prefix, preferred templates
- **Cross-platform builds** - Optional Docker setup for building from any host
- **Code signing** - Optional setup for macOS, Windows, and Linux

Configuration is saved to `~/.config/wails/config.yaml` and used by `wails3 init`.

## Sub-Commands

```bash
wails3 setup signing      # Configure code signing
wails3 setup entitlements # Configure macOS entitlements
```

## Having Issues?

1. Run `wails3 doctor` to diagnose problems
2. Follow the [manual installation steps](/docs/getting-started/installation#platform-specific-dependencies)
3. [Report the issue](https://github.com/wailsapp/wails/issues/4904) with your `wails3 doctor` output

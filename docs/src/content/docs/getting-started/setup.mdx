The `wails3 setup` command provides an interactive wizard that helps configure your development environment for building Wails applications.

<Aside type="caution" title="Experimental Feature">
  The setup wizard is new and primarily tested on Linux. If you encounter issues on macOS or Windows, please [report them](https://github.com/wailsapp/wails/issues/4904) and follow the [manual installation steps](/docs/getting-started/installation#platform-specific-dependencies) instead.
</Aside>

## Quick Start

After [installing the Wails CLI](/docs/getting-started/installation#installation), run:

```bash
wails3 setup
```

This launches a browser-based wizard that guides you through:

<Steps>
1. **System Check** - Verifies required dependencies (Go, npm, platform tooling)
2. **Cross-Platform Builds** - Optional Docker setup for building Windows/macOS/Linux from any host
3. **Project Defaults** - Configure author info, bundle ID prefix, preferred templates
4. **Code Signing** - Optional setup for macOS, Windows, and Linux signing
</Steps>

## What It Configures

The setup wizard creates a global configuration file at `~/.config/wails/config.yaml` containing:

- **Author defaults** - Name and company for new projects
- **Project defaults** - Bundle ID prefix, default template, version format
- **Signing configuration** - Platform-specific code signing settings

These defaults are used when running `wails3 init` to create new projects.

## Sub-Commands

The setup command also includes focused wizards for specific tasks:

### Code Signing Setup

```bash
wails3 setup signing
```

Interactive wizard for configuring code signing on your current platform.

### macOS Entitlements

```bash
wails3 setup entitlements
```

Configure macOS entitlements for your application (sandbox, hardened runtime, etc).

## Having Issues?

If the setup wizard doesn't work on your system:

1. Run `wails3 doctor` to diagnose dependency issues
2. Follow the [manual installation steps](/docs/getting-started/installation#platform-specific-dependencies) for your platform
3. [Report the issue](https://github.com/wailsapp/wails/issues/4904) with your `wails3 doctor` output so we can improve the wizard

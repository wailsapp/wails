```bash
cd docs
npm install
npm run dev
```

**Verify:**
- [ ] Navigation works correctly
- [ ] All new pages render properly
- [ ] Links work (no 404s)
- [ ] D2 diagrams render (if any generated)

- [ ] Responsive design works on mobile

### 2. Get Community Feedback (1-2 days)

**Share in Discord:**
```
ðŸŽ‰ Wails v3 Documentation Redesign - Preview Available!

We've completely redesigned the docs following Netflix's approach:
- Problem-first framing
- Progressive disclosure
- Real production examples
- Multiple learning paths

Preview the new Quick Start: [link to deployed preview]

Feedback welcome! What works? What's confusing?
```

**Questions to ask:**
- Is the navigation intuitive?
- Does the Quick Start get you productive quickly?
- Are the learning paths clear?
- What's missing?

### 3. Complete Core Concepts (6-8 hours)

Create these 3 pages in `src/content/docs/concepts/`:

- [ ] **lifecycle.mdx** - Application lifecycle, startup/shutdown hooks

5. **Iterate based on feedback**

### If You Have Help

**Person 1: Content Migration**
- Migrate Features documentation
- Update to new format
- Verify accuracy

**Person 2: Tutorial Creation**
- Create complete tutorials
- Test on all platforms
- Record videos (optional)

**Person 3: API Reference**
- Auto-generate where possible
- Write manual documentation
- Add code examples

### If You're Handing Off

**Share these files:**
1. `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Full status report
2. `DOCUMENTATION_REDESIGN_STATUS.md` - Detailed tracking
3. `NEXT_STEPS.md` - This file
4. Existing content in `src/content/docs/learn/` and `src/content/docs/guides/`

**Key points to communicate:**
- Foundation is solid, structure is proven
- ~80% of work is migrating/updating existing content
- Netflix principles are the guide
- International English spelling throughout
- Test all code examples

# Wails v3 Documentation Redesign - Status Report

**Branch:** `docs-redesign-netflix`  
**Started:** 2025-10-01  
**Approach:** Netflix Documentation Principles

## Netflix Principles Applied

1. **Start with the Problem** âœ…
   - Homepage explains the desktop app dilemma
   - "Why Wails?" addresses pain points first
   - Real-world impact metrics (memory, bundle size, startup time)

2. **Progressive Disclosure** âœ…
   - Quick Start for beginners (4 steps)
   - Tutorials for hands-on learners
   - Features for systematic exploration
   - Reference for deep dives

3. **Real Production Examples** ðŸ”„ In Progress
   - Tutorials use real scenarios (Todo, Dashboard, File Manager)
   - No toy examples
   - Production-ready patterns

4. **Story-Code-Context Pattern** âœ…
   - Why (problem) â†’ How (code) â†’ When (context)
   - Every major section follows this pattern

5. **Scannable Content** âœ…
   - Clear headings
   - Code blocks with syntax highlighting
   - Callout boxes for important info
   - Visual placeholders for diagrams

6. **Failure Scenarios** âœ…
   - Troubleshooting sections
   - Common errors documented
   - "When NOT to use" guidance

## Estimated Completion

### Completed: ~15%
- Infrastructure: 100%
- Quick Start: 100%
- Homepage: 100%

### Remaining: ~85%
- Core Concepts: 0%
- Features: 0% (content exists, needs reorganisation)
- Tutorials: 10% (structure done, content needed)
- Guides: 0% (content exists, needs reorganisation)
- API Reference: 0%
- Contributing: 0%
- Migration: 0%

### Time Estimate
- **Remaining work**: 40-60 hours
- **With automation**: 30-40 hours (auto-generate API docs)
- **With team**: 20-30 hours (parallel work on sections)

## Notes for Continuation

1. **Preserve Existing Content**: Don't delete existing docs, migrate and improve them
2. **Test All Code**: Every code example must be tested and working
3. **Add Diagrams**: Use D2 for all architectural diagrams
4. **Cross-Reference**: Link related content extensively
5. **Get Feedback**: Share with community early and often
6. **Iterate**: Documentation is never "done", plan for updates

## Questions for Review

1. **Navigation Structure**: Is the sidebar organisation intuitive?
2. **Learning Paths**: Do the three paths (tutorials, features, guides) make sense?
3. **Tone**: Is the conversational style appropriate?
4. **Depth**: Is the Quick Start too detailed or just right?
5. **Visuals**: Are the placeholder descriptions clear enough for designers?

**This is a living document.** Update as work progresses.

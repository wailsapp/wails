## Netflix Principles Applied

### ✅ 1. Start with the Problem
- Homepage explains desktop app dilemma before solution
- "Why Wails?" addresses pain points first
- Every major section frames the problem

### ✅ 2. Progressive Disclosure
- Quick Start: 4 steps, 30 minutes to working app
- Tutorials: Hands-on learning
- Features: Systematic exploration
- Reference: Deep technical details

### ✅ 3. Real Production Examples
- No toy examples
- Real-world metrics (memory, bundle size)
- Production-ready patterns
- Battle-tested solutions

### ✅ 4. Story-Code-Context Pattern
Every section follows:
1. **Story**: Why does this exist? What problem?
2. **Code**: Working examples
3. **Context**: When to use, when not to use

### ✅ 5. Scannable Content
- Clear headings (H2, H3 hierarchy)
- Code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Callout boxes (tip, note, caution, danger)
- Tables for comparisons
- Cards for navigation

### ✅ 6. Failure Scenarios
- Troubleshooting sections in every guide
- "When NOT to use" guidance
- Common errors documented
- Platform-specific gotchas

**Optimised Total**: 81-110 hours (~2 weeks full-time)

### With Team
- Parallel work on sections: -30 hours
- Community contributions: -10 hours

**Team Total**: 51-80 hours (~1-2 weeks with 2-3 people)

## Key Decisions Made

### 1. Navigation Structure

- **Features** (not "Learn") - Clearer purpose
- **Tutorials** separate from Guides - Different learning styles
- **Contributing** prominent - Encourage contributions

### 2. Content Organisation
- **Problem-first**: Every section starts with "why"
- **Progressive disclosure**: TL;DR → Details
- **Real examples**: No toy code
- **Visual aids**: Diagrams for complex concepts

### 3. Writing Style
- **International English**: Consistent with project standards
- **Conversational**: Approachable but professional
- **Scannable**: Short paragraphs, clear headings
- **Practical**: Focus on what developers need

### 4. Technical Approach
- **D2 for diagrams**: Better than Mermaid for architecture
- **Starlight**: Excellent documentation framework
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe examples
- **Platform-specific**: Document differences clearly

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Complete Core Concepts** - Foundation for everything else
2. **Migrate Features** - Most content exists, quick wins
3. **Create 2-3 tutorials** - Validate tutorial format

### Short-term (1-2 weeks)
1. **Complete API Reference** - Critical for developers
2. **Create Contributing guide** - Onboard contributors
3. **Get community feedback** - Share in Discord

### Medium-term (1 month)
1. **Complete all tutorials** - Cover all major use cases
2. **Create migration guides** - Help v2 users upgrade
3. **Add diagrams** - Visualise complex concepts

### Long-term (Ongoing)
1. **Community contributions** - Encourage tutorials
2. **Keep updated** - Documentation is never "done"
3. **Translations** - Reach global audience
4. **Video content** - Complement written docs

## Notes for Continuation

### Important Considerations
1. **Preserve existing content** - Don't delete, migrate and improve
2. **Test all code** - Every example must work
3. **Cross-reference extensively** - Help users navigate
4. **Get feedback early** - Share with community
5. **Iterate continuously** - Documentation evolves

### Technical Debt
- Some existing docs need accuracy verification
- Code examples need testing on all platforms
- Diagrams need professional design
- Some API docs need completion

### Community Engagement
- Share progress in Discord
- Ask for feedback on structure
- Invite tutorial contributions
- Recognise community contributors

## Conclusion

The foundation for world-class Wails v3 documentation is complete. The new structure follows Netflix principles and provides clear learning paths for different user types. The Quick Start section is production-ready and demonstrates the quality standard for remaining content.

**Next milestone**: Complete Core Concepts and migrate Features documentation to validate the new structure and get community feedback.

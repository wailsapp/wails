The `partialCached` template function can offer significant performance gains for complex templates that don't need to be re-rendered on every invocation.


**Note:** Each Site (or language) has its own `partialCached` cache, so each site will execute a partial once.

Here is the simplest usage:

```
{{ partialCached "footer.html" . }}
```

You can also pass additional parameters to `partialCached` to create *variants* of the cached partial. For example, if you have a complex partial that should be identical when rendered for pages within the same section, you could use a variant based upon section so that the partial is only rendered once per section:

{{< code file="partial-cached-example.html" >}}
{{ partialCached "footer.html" . .Section }}
{{< /code >}}

If you need to pass additional parameters to create unique variants, you can pass as many variant parameters as you need:

```
{{ partialCached "footer.html" . .Params.country .Params.province }}
```

Note that the variant parameters are not made available to the underlying partial template. They are only use to create a unique cache key.

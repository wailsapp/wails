`path.Ext` returns the file name extension `PATH`.

The extension is the suffix beginning at the final dot in the final slash-separated element `PATH`;
it is empty if there is no dot.

**Note:** On Windows, `PATH` is converted to slash (`/`) separators.

```
{{ path.Ext "a/b/c/news.html" }} â†’ ".html"
```

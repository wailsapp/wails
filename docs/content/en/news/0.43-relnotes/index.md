categories: ["Releases"]
---

	Hugo `0.43` adds a powerful and very simple to use **Assets Pipeline** with **SASS and SCSS** with source map support, **PostCSS** and **minification** and **fingerprinting** and **Subresource Integrity** and ... much more. Oh, did we mention that you can now do **ad-hoc image processing** and execute text resources as Go templates?

An example pipeline:

```go-html-template
{{ $styles := resources.Get "scss/main.scss" | toCSS | postCSS | minify | fingerprint }}
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ $styles.Permalink }}" integrity="{{ $styles.Data.Integrity }}" media="screen">
```

To me, the above is beautiful in its speed and simplicity. It could be printed on a t-shirt. I wrote in the [Hugo Birthday Post](https://gohugo.io/news/lets-celebrate-hugos-5th-birthday/) some days ago about the value of a single binary with native and fast implementations. I should have added _simplicity_ as a keyword. There seem to be a misconception that all of this needs to be hard and painful.

New functions to create `Resource` objects:

* `resources.Get`
* `resources.FromString`: Create a Resource from a string.

New `Resource` transformation funcs:

* `resources.ToCSS`: Compile `SCSS` or `SASS` into `CSS`.
* `resources.PostCSS`: Process your CSS with PostCSS. Config file support (project or theme or passed as an option).
* `resources.Minify`: Currently supports `css`, `js`, `json`, `html`, `svg`, `xml`.
* `resources.Fingerprint`: Creates a fingerprinted version of the given Resource with Subresource Integrity.
* `resources.Concat`: Concatenates a list of Resource objects. Think of this as a poor man's bundler.
* `resources.ExecuteAsTemplate`: Parses and executes the given Resource and data context (e.g. .Site) as a Go template.


I, [@bep](https://github.com/bep), implemented this in [dea71670](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/commit/dea71670c059ab4d5a42bd22503f18c087dd22d4). We will work hard to get the documentation up to date, but follow the links above for details, and also see this [demo project](https://github.com/bep/hugo-sass-test).


This release represents **35 contributions by 7 contributors** to the main Hugo code base.
[@bep](https://github.com/bep) leads the Hugo development with a significant amount of contributions, but also a big shoutout to [@anthonyfok](https://github.com/anthonyfok), [@openscript](https://github.com/openscript), and [@caarlos0](https://github.com/caarlos0) for their ongoing contributions.
And a big thanks to [@digitalcraftsman](https://github.com/digitalcraftsman) for his relentless work on keeping the themes site in pristine condition and to [@kaushalmodi](https://github.com/kaushalmodi) for his great work on the documentation site.

Many have also been busy writing and fixing the documentation in [hugoDocs](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugoDocs), 
which has received **11 contributions by 5 contributors**. A special thanks to [@bep](https://github.com/bep), [@danrl](https://github.com/danrl), [@regisphilibert](https://github.com/regisphilibert), and [@digitalcraftsman](https://github.com/digitalcraftsman) for their work on the documentation site.

Hugo now has:

* 26968+ [stars](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/stargazers)
* 443+ [contributors](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/graphs/contributors)
* 238+ [themes](http://themes.gohugo.io/)

## Notes

* Replace deprecated {Get,}ByPrefix with {Get,}Match [42ed6025](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/commit/42ed602580a672e420e1d860384e812f4871ff67) [@anthonyfok](https://github.com/anthonyfok) 
* Hugo is now released with two binary version: One with and one without SCSS/SASS support. At the time of writing, this is only available in the binaries on the GitHub release page. Brew, Snap builds etc. will come. But note that you **only need the extended version if you want to edit SCSS**. For your CI server, or if you don't use SCSS, you will most likely want the non-extended version.

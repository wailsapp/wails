Hugo `0.44` is the follow-up release, or **The Sequel**, of the very well received `0.43` only days ago. That release added **Hugo Pipes**, with SCSS/SASS support, assets bundling and minification, ad-hoc image processing and much more.

This is mostly a bug-fix release, but it also includes several important improvements.

Many complained that their SVG images vanished when browsed from the `hugo server`. With **Hugo Pipes** MIME types suddenly got really important, but Hugo's use of `Suffix` was ambiguous. This became visible when we redefined the `image/svg+xml` to work with **Hugo Pipes**. We have now added a `Suffixes` field on the MIME type definition in Hugo, which is a list of one or more filename suffixes the MIME type is identified with. If you need to add a custom MIME type definition, this means that you also need to specify the full MIME type as the key, e.g. `image/svg+xml`.

Hugo now has:

* 27120+ [stars](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/stargazers)
* 443+ [contributors](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/graphs/contributors)
* 239+ [themes](http://themes.gohugo.io/)

## Notes
* `MediaType.Suffix` is deprecated and replaced with a plural version,  `MediaType.Suffixes`, with a more specific definition. You will get a detailed WARNING in the console if you need to do anything.

* Allow multiple file suffixes per media type [b874a1ba](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/commit/b874a1ba7ab8394dc741c8c70303a30a35b63e43) [@bep](https://github.com/bep) [#4920](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/issues/4920)

description: "Hugo 0.38: Date and slug from filenames, multiple content dirs, config from themes, language merge func â€¦"
categories: ["Releases"]
---

Hugo `0.38` is an **Easter egg** filled with good stuff. We now support fetching **date and slug from the content filename**, making the move from Jekyll even easier. And you can now set `contentDir` per language with intelligent merging, and themes can now provide configuration ...  Also worth mentioning is several improvements in the [Chroma](https://github.com/alecthomas/chroma) highlighter, most notable support for Go templates.

We are working hard to get the documentation up-to-date with the new features, but you can also see them in action with the full source at [hugotest.bep.is](http://hugotest.bep.is/).

This release represents **39 contributions by 4 contributors** to the main Hugo code base.
[@bep](https://github.com/bep) leads the Hugo development with a significant amount of contributions, but also a big shoutout to [@anthonyfok](https://github.com/anthonyfok), [@felicianotech](https://github.com/felicianotech), and [@paulcmal](https://github.com/paulcmal) for their ongoing contributions.

And a big thanks to [@digitalcraftsman](https://github.com/digitalcraftsman) for his relentless work on keeping the themes site in pristine condition and to [@kaushalmodi](https://github.com/kaushalmodi) for his great work on the documentation site.

Also, a shoutout to [@regisphilibert](https://github.com/regisphilibert) for his work on the new [Code Toggle Shortcode](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/code-toggle/) on the Hugo docs site, which we will put to good use to improve all the configuration samples.

Many have also been busy writing and fixing the documentation in [hugoDocs](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugoDocs), 
which has received **55 contributions by 18 contributors**. A special thanks to [@kaushalmodi](https://github.com/kaushalmodi), [@bep](https://github.com/bep), [@xa0082249956](https://github.com/xa0082249956), and [@paulcmal](https://github.com/paulcmal) for their work on the documentation site.


Hugo now has:

* 24547+ [stars](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/stargazers)
* 447+ [contributors](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/graphs/contributors)
* 213+ [themes](http://themes.gohugo.io/)

## Notes

* Hugo now allows partial redefinition `outputs` in your site configuration. This is what most people would expect, but it is still a change in behaviour. For details, see [#4487](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/issues/4487)
* Before this release, Hugo flattened URLs of processed images in sub-folders. This worked fine but was not intentional. See [#4502](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/issues/4502).

title: "Hugo 0.39: The Nat King Cole Stabilizer Edition"
description: "Hugo 0.39: Rewrite of the /commands package, `Resource.Content`, several new template funcs, and more â€¦"
categories: ["Releases"]
---

	
**Nat King Cole** was a fantastic American jazz pianist. When his bass player had visited the bar a little too often, he started with his percussive	piano playing to keep the tempo flowing. Oscar Peterson called it _"Nat's stabilizers"_. This release is the software equivalent of that. We have been doing frequent main releases this year, but looking back, the patch releases that followed them seemed unneeded. And looking at the regressions, most of them stem from the `commands` package, a package that before this release was filled with globals and high coupling. This package is now rewritten and accompanied with decent test coverage.

But this release isn't all boring and technical: It includes several important bug fixes, several useful new template functions, and `Resource.Content` allows you to get any resource's content without having to fiddle with file paths and `readFile`.

This release represents **61 contributions by 4 contributors** to the main Hugo code base. A shout-out to [@bep](https://github.com/bep) for the implementation and [@it-gro](https://github.com/it-gro) and [@RickCogley](https://github.com/RickCogley) for the help testing it.

[@bep](https://github.com/bep) leads the Hugo development with a significant amount of contributions and his witty Norwegian humour, but also a big shoutout to [@anthonyfok](https://github.com/anthonyfok), [@thedodobird2](https://github.com/thedodobird2), and [@neurocline](https://github.com/neurocline) for their ongoing contributions.
And a big thanks to [@digitalcraftsman](https://github.com/digitalcraftsman) for his relentless work on keeping the themes site in pristine condition and to [@kaushalmodi](https://github.com/kaushalmodi) for his great work on the documentation site.

Many have also been busy writing and fixing the documentation in [hugoDocs](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugoDocs), 
which has received **6 contributions by 5 contributors**. A special thanks to [@kaushalmodi](https://github.com/kaushalmodi), [@regisphilibert](https://github.com/regisphilibert), [@bep](https://github.com/bep), and [@tomanistor](https://github.com/tomanistor) for their work on the documentation site.

Hugo now has:

* 24911+ [stars](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/stargazers)
* 446+ [contributors](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/graphs/contributors)
* 218+ [themes](http://themes.gohugo.io/)

## Notes

* The `main.Execute` function now returns a `Response` object and the global `Hugo` variable is removed. This is only relevant for people building some kind of API around Hugo.
* Remove deprecated `File.Bytes` [94c8b29c](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/commit/94c8b29c39d0c485ee91d98c08fd615c28802496) [@bep](https://github.com/bep)

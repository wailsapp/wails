At Over we're into creativity, and technology should not get in the way. We want it to be easy for everyone to create, and Hugo does the same for us. That's one of the reasons many of us are fond of using it.

People from all disciplines contribute to our website, be it legal documentation, layout and design, recruiting, marketing and of course… engineering. Hugo allows us to do this with as little friction as possible. A lot of this comes down to Hugo being distributed as a single static binary. Copy, paste, run... and you're up and running!

We use [Wercker](https://www.wercker.com/) for continuous integration and deployments, [GitHub](https://github.com/) for contributing to and writing markdown and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/) for hosting.

This infrastructure takes all the pressure off our engineers, anyone can contribute to our website. Anyone else can review the changes, and of course anyone with permission can deploy those approved changes as well!

We're busy working on a few new features for our website, and Hugo continues to deliver above and beyond. We're so happy with the choice we made to use Hugo and to us it has become the de-facto static site generator.

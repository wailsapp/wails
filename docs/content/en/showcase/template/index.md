Have a **notable Hugo site[^1]**? We would love to feature it in this **Showcase Section**

We would really appreciate if you could:

1. Fork https://github.com/gohugoio/hugoDocs
2. Run `hugo new showcase/your-site` (this requires >= Hugo 0.49). This will use the archetype bundle in the [docs repo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugoDocs/tree/master/archetypes).
3. Follow the instructions in the newly created page bundle. 
3. Create a new pull request in https://github.com/gohugoio/hugoDocs/pulls


[^1]: We want this to show Hugo in its best light, so this is not for the average Hugo blog. In most cases the answer to "Is my site [notable](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/notable)?" will be obvious, but if in doubt, create an [issue](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugoDocs/issues) with a link and some words, and we can discuss it. But if you have a site with an interesting Hugo story or a company site where the company itself is notable, you are most welcome.

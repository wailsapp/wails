From the beginning, at Pace, we were focused on solving customer needs and didn't want to over-engineer our marketing or sales. At the same time we didn't want to lock ourselves into a Wordpress, Squarespace or the like.

The ideal was a fast, simple, static site builder. When we came across Hugo we were blown away. Being a European company we wanted to be multi-lingual from the get-go and allow multiple team-members to collaborate and own their content. We also felt that a tech-company in 2018 should be capable of hosting its own blog in a simple way.

Here was Hugo, that allowed us to completely separate content from layout. Our sales-team edit a markdown-file, the engineers commit and off we go -- immediately deployable or pre-viewable.

The only other way to have all that Hugo offers is to go down the full rabbit-hole of building your own server-side React or some such. Possibly Jekyll but again very complex to work with. The alternatives come with too much work for what should be quite simple.

**Hugo + Gulp + Netlify for the win! Don't over engineer your web presence!**

Huge thanks to [@bep](https://github.com/bep) and [community](https://discourse.gohugo.io/) for Hugo.

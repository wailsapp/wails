GitHub provides free and fast static hosting over SSL for personal, organization, or project pages directly from a GitHub repository via its [GitHub Pages service][].

## Assumptions

1. You have Git 2.8 or greater [installed on your machine][installgit].
2. You have a GitHub account. [Signing up][ghsignup] for GitHub is free.
3. You have a ready-to-publish Hugo website or have at least completed the [Quick Start][].

## Types of GitHub Pages

There are 2 types of GitHub Pages:

- User/Organization Pages (`https://<USERNAME|ORGANIZATION>.github.io/`)
- Project Pages (`https://<USERNAME|ORGANIZATION>.github.io/<PROJECT>/`)

Please refer to the [GitHub Pages documentation][ghorgs] to decide which type of site you would like to create as it will determine which of the below methods to use.

To create a User/Organization Pages site, follow the single method in the *GitHub User and Organization Pages* section below.

To create a Project Pages site, choose a method from the *Project Pages* section below.

## GitHub User or Organization Pages

As mentioned [the GitHub Pages documentation][ghorgs], you can host a user/organization page in addition to project pages. Here are the key differences in GitHub Pages websites for Users and Organizations:

1. You must use a `<USERNAME>.github.io` to host your **generated** content
2. Content from the `master` branch will be used to publish your GitHub Pages site

This is a much simpler setup as your Hugo files and generated content are published into two different repositories.

### Step-by-step Instructions

1. Create a `<YOUR-PROJECT>` (e.g. `blog`) repository on GitHub. This repository will contain Hugo's content and other source files.
2. Create a `<USERNAME>.github.io` GitHub repository. This is the repository that will contain the fully rendered version of your Hugo website.
3. `git clone <YOUR-PROJECT-URL> && cd <YOUR-PROJECT>`
4. Paste your existing Hugo project into a new local `<YOUR-PROJECT>` repository. Make sure your website works locally (`hugo server` or `hugo server -t <YOURTHEME>`) and open your browser to <http://localhost:1313>.
5. Once you are happy with the results:
    * Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> to kill the server
    * Before proceeding run `rm -rf public` to completely remove the `public` directory 
6. `git submodule add -b master git@github.com:<USERNAME>/<USERNAME>.github.io.git public`. This creates a git [submodule][]. Now when you run the `hugo` command to build your site to `public`, the created `public` directory will have a different remote origin (i.e. hosted GitHub repository).

### Put it Into a Script

You're almost done. In order to automate next steps create a `deploy.sh` script. You can also make it executable with `chmod +x deploy.sh`.

The following are the contents of the `deploy.sh` script:

```
#!/bin/sh

# If a command fails then the deploy stops
set -e

printf "\033[0;32mDeploying updates to GitHub...\033[0m\n"

# Build the project.
hugo # if using a theme, replace with `hugo -t <YOURTHEME>`

# Go To Public folder
cd public

# Add changes to git.
git add .

# Commit changes.
msg="rebuilding site $(date)"
if [ -n "$*" ]; then
	msg="$*"
fi
git commit -m "$msg"

# Push source and build repos.
git push origin master
```


You can then run `./deploy.sh "Your optional commit message"` to send changes to `<USERNAME>.github.io`. Note that you likely will want to commit changes to your `<YOUR-PROJECT>` repository as well.

That's it! Your personal page should be up and running at `https://<USERNAME>.github.io` within a couple minutes.

## GitHub Project Pages

{{% note %}}
Make sure your `baseURL` key-value in your [site configuration](/getting-started/configuration/) reflects the full URL of your GitHub pages repository if you're using the default GH Pages URL (e.g., `<USERNAME>.github.io/<PROJECT>/`) and not a custom domain.

### Deployment of Project Pages from `/docs` folder on `master` branch

[As described in the GitHub Pages documentation][ghpfromdocs], you can deploy from a folder called `docs/` on your master branch. To effectively use this feature with Hugo, you need to change the Hugo publish directory in your [site's][config] `config.toml` and `config.yaml`, respectively:

```
publishDir = "docs"
```
```
publishDir: docs
```

After running `hugo`, push your master branch to the remote repository and choose the `docs/` folder as the website source of your repo. Do the following from within your GitHub project:

1. Go to **Settings** &rarr; **GitHub Pages**
2. From **Source**,  select "master branch /docs folder". If the option isn't enabled, you likely do not have a `docs/` folder in the root of your project.

{{% note %}}
The `docs/` option is the simplest approach but requires you set a publish directory in your site configuration. You cannot currently configure GitHub pages to publish from another directory on master, and not everyone prefers the output site live concomitantly with source files in version control.

### Deployment of Project Pages From Your `gh-pages` branch

You can also tell GitHub pages to treat your `master` branch as the published site or point to a separate `gh-pages` branch. The latter approach is a bit more complex but has some advantages:

* It keeps your source and generated website in different branches and therefore maintains version control history for both.
* Unlike the preceding `docs/` option, it uses the default `public` folder.

#### Preparations for `gh-pages` Branch

These steps only need to be done once. Replace `upstream` with the name of your remote; e.g., `origin`:

##### Add the `public` Folder

First, add the `public` folder to your `.gitignore` file at the project root so that the directory is ignored on the master branch:

```
echo "public" >> .gitignore
```

##### Initialize Your `gh-pages` Branch

You can now initialize your `gh-pages` branch as an empty [orphan branch][]:

```
git checkout --orphan gh-pages
git reset --hard
git commit --allow-empty -m "Initializing gh-pages branch"
git push upstream gh-pages
git checkout master
```

#### Build and Deployment

Now check out the `gh-pages` branch into your `public` folder using git's [worktree feature][]. Essentially, the worktree allows you to have multiple branches of the same local repository to be checked out in different directories:

```
rm -rf public
git worktree add -B gh-pages public upstream/gh-pages
```

Regenerate the site using the `hugo` command and commit the generated files on the `gh-pages` branch:

{{< code file="commit-gh-pages-files.sh">}}
hugo
cd public && git add --all && git commit -m "Publishing to gh-pages" && cd ..
{{< /code >}}

If the changes in your local `gh-pages` branch look alright, push them to the remote repo:

```
git push upstream gh-pages
```

##### Set `gh-pages` as Your Publish Branch

In order to use your `gh-pages` branch as your publishing branch, you'll need to configure the repository within the GitHub UI. This will likely happen automatically once GitHub realizes you've created this branch. You can also set the branch manually from within your GitHub project:

1. Go to **Settings** &rarr; **GitHub Pages**
2. From **Source**,  select "gh-pages branch" and then **Save**. If the option isn't enabled, you likely have not created the branch yet OR you have not pushed the branch from your local machine to the hosted repository on GitHub.

After a short while, you'll see the updated contents on your GitHub Pages site.

#### Put it Into a Script

To automate these steps, you can create a script with the following contents:

{{< code file="publish_to_ghpages.sh" >}}
#!/bin/sh

if [ "`git status -s`" ]
then
    echo "The working directory is dirty. Please commit any pending changes."
    exit 1;
fi

echo "Deleting old publication"
rm -rf public
mkdir public
git worktree prune
rm -rf .git/worktrees/public/

echo "Checking out gh-pages branch into public"
git worktree add -B gh-pages public upstream/gh-pages

echo "Removing existing files"
rm -rf public/*

echo "Generating site"
hugo

echo "Updating gh-pages branch"
cd public && git add --all && git commit -m "Publishing to gh-pages (publish.sh)"

#echo "Pushing to github"
#git push --all
{{< /code >}}

This will abort if there are pending changes in the working directory and also makes sure that all previously existing output files are removed. Adjust the script to taste, e.g. to include the final push to the remote repository if you don't need to take a look at the gh-pages branch before pushing.

### Deployment of Project Pages from Your `master` Branch

To use `master` as your publishing branch, you'll need your rendered website to live at the root of the GitHub repository. Steps should be similar to that of the `gh-pages` branch, with the exception that you will create your GitHub repository with the `public` directory as the root. Note that this does not provide the same benefits of the `gh-pages` branch in keeping your source and output in separate, but version controlled, branches within the same repo.

You will also need to set `master` as your publishable branch from within the GitHub UI:

1. Go to **Settings** &rarr; **GitHub Pages**
2. From **Source**,  select "master branch" and then **Save**.

## Use a Custom Domain

If you'd like to use a custom domain for your GitHub Pages site, create a file `static/CNAME`. Your custom domain name should be the only contents inside `CNAME`. Since it's inside `static`, the published site will contain the CNAME file at the root of the published site, which is a requirements of GitHub Pages.

Refer to the [official documentation for custom domains][domains] for further information.

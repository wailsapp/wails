One of Hugo's greatest strengths is it's passionate---and always evolving---developer community. With the exception of the `highlight` shortcode mentioned in [Syntax Highlighting][syntax], the tools and other projects featured in this section are offerings from both commercial services and open-source projects, many of which are developed by Hugo developers just like you.

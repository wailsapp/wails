# Wails v3 Documentation

[![Built with Starlight](https://astro.badg.es/v2/built-with-starlight/tiny.svg)](https://starlight.astro.build)

World-class documentation for Wails v3, redesigned following Netflix documentation principles.

## ðŸ“š Documentation Redesign (2025-10-01)

This documentation has been completely redesigned to follow the **Netflix approach** to developer documentation:

- **Problem-first framing** - Start with why, not what
- **Progressive disclosure** - Multiple entry points for different skill levels
- **Real production examples** - No toy code
- **Story-Code-Context pattern** - Why â†’ How â†’ When
- **Scannable content** - Clear structure, visual aids

**Status:** Foundation complete (~20%), ready for content migration

See [IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md](./IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md) for full details.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro + Starlight project, you'll see the following folders and
files:

```sh
.
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ docs/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ config.ts
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ env.d.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

Starlight looks for `.md` or `.mdx` files in the `src/content/docs/` directory.
Each file is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Images can be added to `src/assets/` and embedded in Markdown with a relative
link.

Static assets, like favicons, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |

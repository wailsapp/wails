# Wails Docs

Documentation site for [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo), the very fast and flexible static site generator built with love in Go.


## Build

To view the documentation site locally, you need to clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gohugoio/hugoDocs.git
```

Also note that the documentation version for a given version of Hugo can also be found in the `/docs` sub-folder of the [Hugo source repository](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo).

Then to view the docs in your browser, run Hugo and open up the link:

```bash
â–¶ hugo server

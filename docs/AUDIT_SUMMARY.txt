WAILS V3 DOCUMENTATION AUDIT - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================================================================================

Date: November 22, 2025
Scope: /Users/leaanthony/bugfix/wails/docs/src/content/docs/
Status: Wails v3 Alpha (Daily Release Strategy Active)
Full Report: DOCUMENTATION_AUDIT_REPORT.md (978 lines)

================================================================================
KEY FINDINGS
================================================================================

TOTAL FILES: 142 documentation files across 20 categories

QUALITY ASSESSMENT:
  ✓ Complete & Current:      ~60 files (Windows, Menus, Dialogs, Bindings, Guides)
  ⚠ Incomplete:              ~20 files (Reference APIs, Contributing, Migration)
  ✗ Missing:                 ~56 files (Referenced in sidebar but don't exist)
  ✗ Redundant:               ~24 files (Legacy "learn" folder duplicates features)
  ✗ Orphaned:                ~2 files (Getting-started folder)

CRITICAL ISSUES:
  1. 56+ broken sidebar links (40% of sidebar references missing files)
  2. 7,125 lines of duplicate content in "learn" vs "features" folders
  3. Sidebar structure aspirational vs flat reality (dev/, build/, etc.)
  4. Reference API documentation severely sparse (only 4 files)
  5. Features documentation incomplete (14 missing feature docs)

LINE COUNTS BY QUALITY:
  - Well-maintained content:      ~30,000 lines (features, guides, quick-start)
  - Sparse/incomplete content:     ~8,000 lines (reference, contributing)
  - Redundant legacy content:      ~7,125 lines (learn folder)
  - Total documented:            ~50,000+ lines

REDUNDANT & ORPHANED (24 legacy files + 2 orphaned folders):

  ✗ /getting-started/ (2 files)              - Not in sidebar, redundant

MISSING SIDEBAR FILES (56 expected but don't exist):
  - /guides/dev/* (4 files)                  - Missing entirely
  - /guides/build/windows.mdx, /macos.mdx, /linux.mdx
  - /guides/distribution/* (4 files)         - Expected nested structure
  - /guides/patterns/* (4 files)              - Missing nested structure
  - /guides/advanced/* (4 files)              - Missing nested structure

  - /migration/from-electron.mdx             - Missing

================================================================================
ROOT CAUSES
================================================================================

1. INCOMPLETE RESTRUCTURING
   - Project migrated from flat "learn" folder to organized "features/guides/reference"
   - Sidebar updated for new structure, but files not yet reorganized
   - Result: Mismatch between sidebar definition and actual implementation

2. DUAL DOCUMENTATION SETS
   - Legacy "learn" folder created before new structure
   - New "features" folder created to replace it
   - Both exist simultaneously, causing duplication and confusion
   - Example: Windows documented in 6 separate locations (learn, features, guides)

3. MISSING REFERENCE DOCUMENTATION
   - API documentation is aspirational but sparse
   - Generated API docs (TypeScript bindings) not documented
   - Event types, dialog options not fully documented

4. INCOMPLETE FEATURE COVERAGE
   - Newer features (drag-drop) documented only in code
   - Platform-specific features scattered across locations
   - Event system split expects 4 docs, only 1 exists

================================================================================
PRIORITY RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

HIGH PRIORITY (BLOCKING - Fix immediately):
  1. Delete/consolidate /learn folder (7,125 lines removed, 1-2 weeks)
  2. Fix sidebar/implementation mismatch (create expected file structure, 2-3 weeks)
  3. Create 14 missing feature documentation files (3-4 weeks)

MEDIUM PRIORITY (Important - Fix within 1 month):
  4. Expand reference/API documentation (sparse, 3-4 weeks)
  5. Remove orphaned /getting-started folder (1 week)
  6. Archive old v2 blog posts (1 week)
  7. Complete contributing documentation (2-3 weeks)

LOW PRIORITY (Enhancements - Nice to have):
  8. Add framework-specific tutorials (React, Vue, Svelte - 4-6 weeks)
  9. Expand troubleshooting section (2-3 weeks)
  10. Create Electron migration guide (1-2 weeks)
  11. Consolidate platform-specific documentation (2-3 weeks)

TOTAL EFFORT TO FIX CRITICAL ISSUES: 6-9 weeks of focused work

================================================================================
EXPECTED OUTCOMES AFTER AUDIT FIXES
================================================================================

✓ No redundant documentation (learn folder consolidated/deleted)
✓ 100% valid sidebar links (no broken references)
✓ 160+ documentation files (142 current + 14+ new + reorganized structure)
✓ Clear documentation hierarchy (features → guides → reference → contributing)
✓ Complete feature coverage (all implemented features documented)
✓ Comprehensive API reference (all major APIs with signatures/examples)
✓ Platform-specific consolidated (consistent macos/, windows/, linux/ structure)
✓ Contributing guide complete (setup, workflow, standards, PR process)
✓ Tutorial variety (vanilla, React, Vue, Svelte examples)

================================================================================
NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

1. Review this audit report with team
2. Prioritize which issues to address first
3. Assign team members to Phase 1 tasks (learn folder + sidebar fix)
4. Begin cleanup and reorganization
5. Track progress against timeline
6. Re-audit after Phase 1 to verify improvements

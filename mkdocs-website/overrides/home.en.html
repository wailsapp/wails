            <h2>FAQ</h2>
            <h3>What is the aim of the alpha release?</h3>
            The aim of the alpha release is to get feedback on the new API and to get people experimenting with it.
            We want to make sure that the API is easy to use and that it is possible to build applications with it.
            <br/><br/>
            <h3>How do I provide feedback?</h3>
            Please read <a href="/getting-started/feedback/">this page</a> for details on how to provide feedback.
            </div>
            <h3>Is there a Roadmap</h3>
            Yes, you can find it <a href="/roadmap/">here</a>.

          Please feel free to raise PRs against this website. Every single PR helps us get closer to a release.<br/><br/>
          Thank you for sharing this journey with us.<br/><br/>

# Next Steps

Now that you have created your first application, you can start exploring the other features that v3 alpha provides.


## Examples

The best place to start is the `examples` directory in the Wails repository.
This contains a number of examples that you can run and play with.

To run an example, you can simply use:

```shell
go run .
```

in the example directory.

!!! note
    Some examples may not work during alpha development.

### Changed

- The bundled JS runtime script is now an ESM module: script tags importing it must have the `type="module"` attribute. By [@fbbdev](https://github.com/fbbdev) in [#3295](https://github.com/wailsapp/wails/pull/3295)
- The `@wailsio/runtime` package does not publish its API on the `window.wails` object, and does not start the WML system. This has been done to improve encapsulation. The WML system can be started manually if desired by calling the new `WML.Enable` method. The bundled JS runtime script still performs both operations automatically. By [@fbbdev](https://github.com/fbbdev) in [#3295](https://github.com/wailsapp/wails/pull/3295)
- The Window API module `@wailsio/runtime/src/window` now exposes the containing window object as a default export. It is not possible anymore to import individual methods through ESM named or namespace import syntax.
- The JS window API has been updated to match the current Go `WebviewWindow` API. Some methods have changed name or prototype, specifically: `Screen` becomes `GetScreen`; `GetZoomLevel`/`SetZoomLevel` become `GetZoom`/`SetZoom`; `GetZoom`, `Width` and `Height` now return values directly instead of wrapping them within objects. By [@fbbdev](https://github.com/fbbdev) in [#3295](https://github.com/wailsapp/wails/pull/3295)

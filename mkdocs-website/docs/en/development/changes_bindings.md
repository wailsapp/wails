## Bindings

Bindings work in a similar way to v2, by providing a means to bind struct
methods to the frontend. These can be called in the frontend using the binding
wrappers generated by the `wails3 generate bindings` command:

```javascript
// @ts-check
// Cynhyrchwyd y ffeil hon yn awtomatig. PEIDIWCH Ã‚ MODIWL
// This file is automatically generated. DO NOT EDIT

import { main } from "./models";

window.go = window.go || {};
window.go.main = {
  GreetService: {
    /**
     * GreetService.Greet
     * Greet greets a person
     * @param name {string}
     * @returns {Promise<string>}
     **/
    Greet: function (name) {
      wails.CallByID(1411160069, ...Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 0));
    },

    /**
     * GreetService.GreetPerson
     * GreetPerson greets a person
     * @param person {main.Person}
     * @returns {Promise<string>}
     **/
    GreetPerson: function (person) {
      wails.CallByID(4021313248, ...Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 0));
    },
  },
};
```

Bound methods are obfuscated by default, and are identified using uint32 IDs,
calculated using the
[FNV hashing algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fowler%E2%80%93Noll%E2%80%93Vo_hash_function).
This is to prevent the method name from being exposed in production builds. In
debug mode, the method IDs are logged along with the calculated ID of the method
to aid in debugging. If you wish to add an extra layer of obfuscation, you can
use the `BindAliases` option. This allows you to specify a map of alias IDs to
method IDs. When the frontend calls a method using an ID, the method ID will be
looked up in the alias map first for a match. If it does not find it, it assumes
it's a standard method ID and tries to find the method in the usual way.

Example:

```go
	app := application.New(application.Options{
		Bind: []any{
			&GreetService{},
		},
		BindAliases: map[uint32]uint32{
			1: 1411160069,
			2: 4021313248,
		},
		Assets: application.AssetOptions{
			Handler: application.AssetFileServerFS(assets),
		},
		Mac: application.MacOptions{
			ApplicationShouldTerminateAfterLastWindowClosed: true,
		},
	})
```

We can now call using this alias in the frontend: `wails.Call(1, "world!")`.

### Insecure calls

If you don't mind your calls being available in plain text in your binary and
have no intention of using [garble](https://github.com/burrowers/garble), then
you can use the insecure `wails.CallByName()` method. This method takes the
fully qualified name of the method to call and the arguments to pass to it.
Example:

    ```go
    wails.CallByName("main.GreetService.Greet", "world!")
    ```

    This is only provided as a convenience method for development. It is not recommended to use this in production.

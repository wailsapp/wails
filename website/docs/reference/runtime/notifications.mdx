This part of the runtime provides access to native notifications.

:::info Javascript

Notifications are currently unsupported in the JS runtime.

```go title="Simple Example"
import (
	"github.com/wailsapp/wails/v2/pkg/runtime"
)

//go:embed build/appicon.png
var appicon []byte

//go:embed notify.wav
var notisound []byte

    err := runtime.SendNotification(a.ctx, runtime.NotificationOptions{
		AppID:   "wails",
		AppIcon: appicon,
		Title:   "Wails title",
		Message: "Your message goes here...",
		Timeout: 30 * time.Second,
	})

#### Actions

:::note

Some notification servers may ignore actions.

:::

The actions send a request message back to the notification client when invoked. This functionality may not be implemented by the notification server.
An implementation is free to ignore any requested by the client. 
As an example one possible rendering of actions would be as buttons in the notification popup.

The default action (usually invoked my clicking the notification) should have a key named "default". The name can be anything, though implementations are free not to display it.

Name: Actions<br/>
Type: `[]LinuxNotificationAction`

##### Action Key

Key is the actions's identifier used by the notification server.

Name: Key<br/>
Type: `string`

##### Action Label

Label is the button's text shown to the user.

Name: Label<br/>
Type: `string`

##### Action OnAction

OnAction handles the activated action's signal. This function is called when the user clicks on a button.

Name: OnAction<br/>
Type: `func(notificationID uint32)`

#### Sound

Setting this will play a sound when a notification pops up. Some notification servers may ignore sounds.

Name: Actions<br/>
Type: `*LinuxNotificationSound`

##### Sound Name

Name is a themeable named sound from the freedesktop.org sound naming specification to play
when the notification pops up. An example would be "message-new-instant".
Sound names can be found here: http://0pointer.de/public/sound-naming-spec.html

Name: Name<br/>
Type: `string`

##### Sound File

File to play when the notification pops up. Most notification servers only handle *.wav files. Sound `File` is preferred over `Name` when both are set.

Causes the server to suppress playing any sounds, if it has that ability.
This is usually set when the client itself is going to play its own sound.

Possible reasons:
 - expired
 - dismissed-by-user

# Introduction

The runtime is a library that provides utility methods for your application.
There is both a Go and JavaScript runtime and the aim is to try and keep them at
parity where possible.

It has utility methods for:

- [Window](window.mdx)
- [Menu](menu.mdx)
- [Dialog](dialog.mdx)
- [Events](events.mdx)
- [Browser](browser.mdx)
- [Log](log.mdx)
- [Clipboard](clipboard.mdx)

The Go Runtime is available through importing
`github.com/wailsapp/wails/v2/pkg/runtime`. All methods in this package take a
context as the first parameter. This context should be obtained from the
[OnStartup](../options.mdx#onstartup) or [OnDomReady](../options.mdx#ondomready)
hooks.

:::info Note

Whilst the context will be provided to the [OnStartup](../options.mdx#onstartup)
method, there's no guarantee the runtime will work in this method as the window
is initialising in a different thread. If you wish to call runtime methods at
startup, use [OnDomReady](../options.mdx#ondomready).

:::

The JavaScript library is available to the frontend via the `window.runtime`
map. There is a runtime package generated when using `dev` mode that provides
TypeScript declarations for the runtime. This should be located in the `wailsjs`
directory in your frontend directory.

### Hide

Go: `Hide(ctx context.Context)`<br/> JS: `Hide()`

Hides the application.

:::info Note

On Mac, this will hide the application in the same way as the `Hide` menu item
in standard Mac applications. This is different to hiding the window, but the
application still being in the foreground. For Windows and Linux, this is
currently the same as `WindowHide`.

:::

### Show

Shows the application.

:::info Note

On Mac, this will bring the application back into the foreground. For Windows
and Linux, this is currently the same as `WindowShow`.

:::

Go: `Show(ctx context.Context)`<br/> JS: `Show()`

### Quit

Quits the application.

Go: `Quit(ctx context.Context)`<br/> JS: `Quit()`

### Environment

Returns details of the current environment.

Go: `Environment(ctx context.Context) EnvironmentInfo`<br/> JS:
`Environment(): Promise<EnvironmentInfo>`

#### EnvironmentInfo

Go:

```go
type EnvironmentInfo struct {
	BuildType string
	Platform  string
	Arch      string
}
```

JS:

```ts
interface EnvironmentInfo {
  buildType: string;
  platform: string;
  arch: string;
}
```

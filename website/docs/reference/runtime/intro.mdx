# Introduction

The runtime is a library that provides utility methods for your application. There is both a Go and Javascript runtime
and the aim is to try and keep them at parity where possible.

The Go Runtime is available through importing `github.com/wailsapp/wails/v2/pkg/runtime`. All methods in this package
take a context as the first parameter. This context can be obtained from the [OnStartup](/docs/reference/options#OnStartup)
or [OnDomReady](/docs/reference/options#OnDomReady) hooks.

The Javascript library is available to the frontend via the `window.runtime` map. There is a runtime package generated when using `dev`
mode that provides Typescript declarations for the runtime. This should be located in the `wailsjs` directory in your
frontend directory.

# Application Development

There are no hard and fast rules for developing applications with Wails, but there are some basic guidelines.

## Application Setup

The pattern used by the default templates are that `main.go` is used for configuring and running the application, whilst
`app.go` is used for defining the application logic.

The `app.go` file will define a struct that has 2 methods which act as hooks into the main application:

```go title="app.go"
type App struct {
	ctx context.Context
}

func NewApp() *App {
	return &App{}
}

func (a *App) startup(ctx context.Context) {
	a.ctx = ctx
}

func (a *App) shutdown(ctx context.Context) {
}
```

- The startup method is called as soon as Wails allocates the resources it needs and is a good place for creating resources,
  setting up event listeners and anything else the application needs at startup.
  It is given a `context.Context` which is usually saved in a struct field. This context is needed for calling the
  [runtime](/docs/reference/runtime/intro). If this method returns an error, the application will terminate.
  In dev mode, the error will be output to the console.

- The shutdown method will be called by Wails right at the end of the shutdown process. This is a good place to deallocate
  memory and perform any shutdown tasks.

The `main.go` file generally consists of a single call to `wails.Run()`, which accepts the application configuration.
The pattern used by the templates is that before the call to `wails.Run()`, an instance of the struct we defined in
`app.go` is created and saved in a variable called `app`. This configuration is where we add our callbacks:

```go {3,9,10} title="main.go"
func main() {

	app := NewApp()

	err := wails.Run(&options.App{
		Title:             "My App",
		Width:             800,
		Height:            600,
		OnStartup:  app.startup,
		OnShutdown: app.shutdown,
	})
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
}

```

More information on application lifecycle hooks can be found [here](/docs/howdoesitwork#application-lifecycle-callbacks).

## Binding Methods

It is likely that you will want to call Go methods from the frontend. This is normally done by adding public methods to
the already defined struct in `app.go`:

```go {16-18} title="app.go"
type App struct {
	ctx context.Context
}

func NewApp() *App {
	return &App{}
}

func (a *App) startup(ctx context.Context) {
	a.ctx = ctx
}

func (a *App) shutdown(ctx context.Context) {
}

func (a *App) Greet(name string) string {
    return fmt.Printf("Hello %s!", name)
}
```

In the main application configuration, the `Bind` key is where we can tell Wails what we want to bind:

```go {11-13} title="main.go"
func main() {

	app := NewApp()

	err := wails.Run(&options.App{
		Title:             "My App",
		Width:             800,
		Height:            600,
		OnStartup:  app.startup,
		OnShutdown: app.shutdown,
        Bind: []interface{}{
            app,
        },
	})
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
}

```

This will bind all public methods in our `App` struct (it will never bind the startup and shutdown methods).

More information on Binding can be found [here](/docs/howdoesitwork#method-binding).

## Application Menu

Wails supports adding a menu to your application. This is done by passing a [Menu](/docs/reference/menus#menu) struct
to application config. It's common to use a method that returns a Menu, and even more common for that to be a method on
the `App` struct used for the lifecycle hooks.

```go {11} title="main.go"
func main() {

	app := NewApp()

	err := wails.Run(&options.App{
		Title:             "My App",
		Width:             800,
		Height:            600,
		OnStartup:  app.startup,
		OnShutdown: app.shutdown,
		Menu:       app.menu(),
        Bind: []interface{}{
            app,
        },
	})
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
}

```

## Assets

The great thing about the way Wails v2 handles assets is that it doesn't! The only thing you need to give Wails is an
`embed.FS`. How you get to that is entirely up to you. You can use vanilla html/css/js files like the vanilla template.
You could have some complicated build system, it doesn't matter.

When `wails build` is run, it will check the `wails.json` project file at the project root. There are 2 keys in the
project file that are read:

- "frontend:install"
- "frontend:build"

The first, if given, will be executed in the `frontend` directory to install the node modules.
The second, if given, will be executed in the `frontend` directory to build the frontend project.

If these 2 keys aren't given, then Wails does absolutely nothing with the frontend. It is only expecting that `embed.FS`.

## Live Reloading

Running `wails dev` will start a file watcher in your project directory. By default, if any file changes, wails checks
if it was an application file (default: `.go`, configurable with `-e` flag). If it was, then it will rebuild your
application and relaunch it. If the changed file was in the `assetdir` directory, it will issue a reload.

Some frameworks come with their own live-reloading server, however they will not be able to take advantage of the Wails
Go bindings. In this scenario, it is best to run a watcher script that rebuilds the project into the build directory, which
Wails will be watching. For an example, see the default svelte template that uses [rollup](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/).
For [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/), it's possible to use
[this script](https://gist.github.com/int128/e0cdec598c5b3db728ff35758abdbafd) to achieve a similar result.

## Go Module

The default Wails templates generate a `go.mod` file that contains the module name "changeme". You should change this
to something more appropriate after project generation.

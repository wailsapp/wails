# Troubleshooting

An assortment of troubleshooting tips.

## My application is displaying a white/blank screen

Check that your application includes the assets from the correct directory. In your `main.go` file, you will have
something similar to the following code:

```go
//go:embed frontend/dist
var assets embed.FS
```
Check that `frontend/dist` contains your application assets.

## Mac application not valid

If your built application looks like this in finder:

<p className="text--center">
    <img src="/img/troubleshooting/invalid_mac_app.png"></img>
</p>

it's likely that your application's `info.plist` is invalid. Update the file in `build/<yourapp>.app/Contents/info.plist`
and check if the data is valid, EG check the binary name is correct. To persist the changes, copy the file back to
the `build/darwin` directory.

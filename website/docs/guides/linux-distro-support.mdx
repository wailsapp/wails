# Linux Distro Support

## Overview

Wails offers Linux support but providing installation instructions for all
available distributions is an impossible task. Instead, Wails tries to determine
if the packages you need to develop applications are available via your system's
package manager. Currently, we support the following package managers:

- apt
- dnf
- emerge
- eopkg
- nixpkgs
- pacman
- zypper

## Adding package names

There may be circumstances where your distro uses one of the supported package
managers but the package name is different. For example, you may use an Ubuntu
derivative, but the package name for gtk may be different. Wails attempts to
find the correct package by iterating through a list of package names. The list
of packages are stored in the packagemanager specific file in the
`v2/internal/system/packagemanager` directory. In our example, this would be
`v2/internal/system/packagemanager/apt.go`.

In this file, the list of packages are defined by the `Packages()` method:

```go
func (a *Apt) Packages() packagemap {
	return packagemap{
		"libgtk-3": []*Package{
			{Name: "libgtk-3-dev", SystemPackage: true, Library: true},
		},
		"libwebkit": []*Package{
			{Name: "libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev", SystemPackage: true, Library: true},
		},
		"gcc": []*Package{
			{Name: "build-essential", SystemPackage: true},
		},
		"pkg-config": []*Package{
			{Name: "pkg-config", SystemPackage: true},
		},
		"npm": []*Package{
			{Name: "npm", SystemPackage: true},
		},
		"docker": []*Package{
			{Name: "docker.io", SystemPackage: true, Optional: true},
		},
	}
}
```

Let's assume that in our linux distro, `libgtk-3` is packaged under the name
`lib-gtk3-dev`. We could add support for this by adding the following line:

```go {5}
func (a *Apt) Packages() packagemap {
	return packagemap{
		"libgtk-3": []*Package{
			{Name: "libgtk-3-dev", SystemPackage: true, Library: true},
			{Name: "lib-gtk3-dev", SystemPackage: true, Library: true},
		},
		"libwebkit": []*Package{
			{Name: "libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev", SystemPackage: true, Library: true},
		},
		"gcc": []*Package{
			{Name: "build-essential", SystemPackage: true},
		},
		"pkg-config": []*Package{
			{Name: "pkg-config", SystemPackage: true},
		},
		"npm": []*Package{
			{Name: "npm", SystemPackage: true},
		},
		"docker": []*Package{
			{Name: "docker.io", SystemPackage: true, Optional: true},
		},
	}
}
```

## Adding new package managers

To add a new package manager, perform the following steps:

- Create a new file in `v2/internal/system/packagemanager` called `<pm>.go`,
  where `<pm>` is the name of the package manager.
- Define a struct that conforms to the package manager interface defined in
  `pm.go`:

```go
type PackageManager interface {
	Name() string
	Packages() packagemap
	PackageInstalled(*Package) (bool, error)
	PackageAvailable(*Package) (bool, error)
	InstallCommand(*Package) string
}
```

- `Name()` should return the name of the package manager
- `Packages()` should return a `packagemap`, that provides candidate filenames
  for dependencies
- `PackageInstalled()` should return `true` if the given package is installed
- `PackageAvailable()` should return `true` if the given package is not
  installed but available for installation
- `InstallCommand()` should return the exact command to install the given
  package name

Take a look at the other package managers code to get an idea how this works.

If you add support for a new package manager, don't forget to also update this

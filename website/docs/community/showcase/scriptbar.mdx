[ScriptBar](https://GitHub.com/raguay/ScriptBarApp) is a program to show the output of the embedded [Node-Red](https://nodered.org) server in the [EmailIt](https://GitHub.com/raguay/EmailIt) application. It also displays the output of scripts on your system. ScriptBar doesn't put them in the menubar, but has them all in a convient window for easy viewing. You can have multiple tabs to have many different things show. You can also keep the links to your most visited web sites.

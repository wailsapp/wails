[UpBeat](https://upbeat.mitchelltechnologies.co.uk) is An RSS/Atom Feed Reader for macOS that filters out negative news with locally running ML models.

## Features

- **Local ML**: UpBeat runs a transformer-based sentiment analysis model directly on your Mac's hardware. No waiting for a Cloud GPU to spin up before you can decide what you want to read
- **Apple Neural Engine Enabled**: UpBeat runs its ML models directly on the Neural Engine of Macs. That means you get super-fast inference, but without burning through your battery or electricity bill.
- **Widely Compatible**: Works with the vast majority of RSS + Atom versions.

[GameStacker](https://gamestacker.io) is a modern, elegant console-like interface that unifies your entire game collection into one beautiful dashboard.

## Features

- **Unified Library**: Automatically detects and imports games from external libraries (such as Steam, LaunchBox, and RetroBat), bringing your modern and retro collections into a single, cohesive interface.
- **True Console Experience**: Built for controllers with responsive navigation, UI sound effects, and a dedicated in-game "Guide" overlay to control music and manage your session without alt-tabbing.
- **Achievement Integration**: Tracks your progress across supported services, allowing you to view unlocks and Gamerscore directly from the dashboard.
- **Multi-Profile Support**: Create unique profiles with custom avatars and specific color themes for a personalized experience.

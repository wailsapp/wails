[Modal File Manager](https://github.com/raguay/ModalFileManager) is a dual pane
file manager using web technologies. My original design was based on NW.js and
can be found [here](https://github.com/raguay/ModalFileManager-NWjs). This
version uses the same Svelte based frontend code (but it has be greatly modified
since the departure from NW.js), but the backend is a
[Wails 2](https://wails.io/) implementation. By using this implementation, I no
longer use command line `rm`, `cp`, etc. commands, but a git install has to be
on the system to download themes and extensions. It is fully coded using Go and
runs much faster than the previous versions.

This file manager is designed around the same principle as Vim: a state
controlled keyboard actions. The number of states isn't fixed, but very
programmable. Therefore, an infinite number of keyboard configurations can be
created and used. This is the main difference from other file managers. There
are themes and extensions available to download from GitHub.

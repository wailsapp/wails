# FAQ

## What's with the name?

When I saw WebView, I thought "What I really want is tooling around building a WebView app, a bit like Rails is to Ruby". So initially it was a play on words (**W**ebview on R**ails**). It just so happened to also be a homophone of the English name for the [Country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales) I am from. So it stuck.

## Is this an alternative to Electron?

Depends on your requirements. It's designed to make it easy for Go programmers to make lightweight desktop applications or add a frontend to their existing applications. Wails v2 does offer native elements such as menus and dialogs, so it is becoming a lightweight electron alternative.

## v2.0.0-beta.36 - 2022-04-27

### Fixed

## v2.0.0-beta.35 - 2022-04-27

### Breaking Changes

- When data was sent to the `EventsOn` callback, it was being sent as a slice of values,
  instead of optional parameters to the method. `EventsOn` now works as expected, but you will need to update your code
  if you
  currently use this. [More information](https://github.com/wailsapp/wails/issues/1324)
- The broken `bindings.js` and `bindings.d.ts` files have been replaced by a new JS/TS code generation system. More
  details [here](https://wails.io/docs/howdoesitwork#calling-bound-go-methods)

### Added

- **New Templates**: Svelte, React, Vue, Preact, Lit and Vanilla templates, both JS and TS versions. `wails init -l` for
  more info.
- Default templates now powered by [Vite](https://vitejs.dev). This enables lightning fast reloads when you
  use `wails dev`!
- Add support for external frontend development servers. See `frontend:dev:serverUrl` in
  the [project config](https://wails.io/docs/reference/project-config) - [@stffabi](https://github.com/stffabi)
- [Fully configurable dark mode](https://wails.io/docs/reference/options#theme) for Windows.
- Hugely improved [WailsJS generation](https://wails.io/docs/howdoesitwork#calling-bound-go-methods) (both Javascript
  and Typescript)
- Wails doctor now reports information about the wails installation - [@stffabi](https://github.com/stffabi)

  and [NSIS installer](https://wails.io/docs/guides/windows-installer) - [@gardc](https://github.com/gardc)

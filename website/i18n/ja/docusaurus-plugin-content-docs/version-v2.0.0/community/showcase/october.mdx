[October](https://october.utf9k.net) is a small Wails application that makes it really easy to extract highlights from [Kobo eReaders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobo_eReader) and then forward them to [Readwise](https://readwise.io).

It has a relatively small scope with all platform versions weighing in under 10MB, and that's without enabling [UPX compression](https://upx.github.io/)!

In contrast, the author's previous attempts with Electron quickly bloated to several hundred megabytes.

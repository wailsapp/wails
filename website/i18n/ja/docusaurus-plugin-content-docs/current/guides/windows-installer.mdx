Wails supports generating Windows installers using the [NSIS installer](https://nsis.sourceforge.io/).

## Installing NSIS

### Windows

The installer is available on the [NSIS Download](https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Download) page.

If you use the chocolatey package manager, run the following script:

```
choco install nsis
```

If you install NSIS manually, you need to add the _Bin_ folder, which contains `makensis.exe`, in your NSIS installation to your path. [Here](https://www.architectryan.com/2018/03/17/add-to-the-path-on-windows-10/) is a good tutorial on how to add to path on Windows.

### Linux

The `nsis` package should be available through your distribution's package manager.

### MacOS

NSIS is available to install through homebrew: `brew install nsis`.

## Generating the installer

When a new project is created, Wails generates the NSIS configuration files in `build/windows/installer`. The config data is read from `installer/info.json` and that is configured to use the project's `wails.json` Info section:

```json
// ...
 "Info": {
    "companyName": "My Company Name",
    "productName": "Wails Vite",
    "productVersion": "1.0.0",
    "copyright": "Copyright.........",
    "comments": "Built using Wails (https://wails.io)"
  },
```

To generate an installer for your application, use the `-nsis` flag with `wails build`:

```
wails build -nsis
```

The installer will now be available in the `build/bin` directory.

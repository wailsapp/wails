# Website Stats

To enable us to understand how better to focus our efforts on translations and platform support, we use [Plausible](https://plausible.io/privacy-focused-web-analytics) to gather **anonymous** stats like country and platform. We chose Plausible because we believe in respecting the privacy of our users. We also believe in transparency, therefore have made the dashboard public.

If you have any concerns or suggestions, please raise them in the projects github discussions.

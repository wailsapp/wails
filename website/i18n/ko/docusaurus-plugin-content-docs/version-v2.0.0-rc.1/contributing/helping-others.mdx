# Helping Others

A great way to contribute to the project is to help others who are experiencing difficulty. This is normally reported as a ticket or a message on the Wails slack channel. Even just clarifying the issue can really help out. Sometimes, when an issue is discussed and gets resolved, we create a guide out of it to help others who face the same issues.

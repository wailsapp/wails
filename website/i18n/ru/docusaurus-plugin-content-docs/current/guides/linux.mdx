## Video tag doesn't fire "ended" event

When using a video tag, the "ended" event is not fired when the video is finished playing. This is a bug in WebkitGTK, however you can use the following workaround to fix it:

```js
videoTag.addEventListener("timeupdate", (event) => {
  if (event.target.duration - event.target.currentTime < 0.2) {
    let ended = new Event("ended");
    event.target.dispatchEvent(ended);
  }
});
```

# Angular

Whilst Wails does not have an Angular template, it is possible to use Angular with Wails.

## Dev Mode

To get dev mode working with Angular, you need to add the following to your `wails.json`:

```json
  "frontend:build": "npx ng build",
  "frontend:install": "npm install",
  "frontend:dev:watcher": "npx ng serve",
  "frontend:dev:serverUrl": "http://localhost:4200",
```

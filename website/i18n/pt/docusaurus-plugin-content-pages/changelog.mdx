## v2.2.0 - 2022-11-09

### Adicionado

- Wails now uses a purpose built, native Go implementation of Microsoft's webview2loader dll. This means there is no need to embed the `Webview2Loader.dll` file in your binaries, meaning filesizes will be ~130k smaller! Thanks to @stffabi for this [awesome contribution](https://github.com/wailsapp/wails/pull/1974)!
- This release provides much more control over custom asset handling via the new [AssetServer](https://wails.io/docs/reference/options#assetserver) options. This allows you to provide your own custom asset handler and hook into the request chain through middleware. Thanks to @stffabi for this [awesome contribution](https://github.com/wailsapp/wails/pull/2016) and @mholt for the [initial idea](https://github.com/wailsapp/wails/issues/2007) and extensive testing.
- It is now possible to customise the layout of your Wails projects using 2 new options in `wails.json`:
  - `build:dir` can be used to specify where the build files reside
  - `frontend:dir` can be used to specify where the frontend files reside
  - If `go.mod` is not found in the same directory as `wails.json`, the cli will look up the parent directories to find it. Fixed by @leaanthony in this [PR](https://github.com/wailsapp/wails/pull/2009)
- Colour output in the CLI can now be turned off by using the `--nocolor` flag. This is useful for CI/CD pipelines. Thanks to @scottopell for the [PR](https://github.com/wailsapp/wails/pull/1947)
- A JSON schema definition for the `wails.json` file has been added. IDEs should now provide code complete when editing `wails.json`. Thanks to @binyamin for the [PR](https://github.com/wailsapp/wails/pull/1864)
- The `EventsOn*` methods now return a function that can be called to deregister the listener. Thanks to @joshbuddy for the [PR](https://github.com/wailsapp/wails/pull/1969)

### Corrigido

- Webview2 on Windows returns a potential whitespace when defining the style like this style="--wails-draggable: drag". Fixed by @stffabi in https://github.com/wailsapp/wails/pull/1989
- Bound structs that had `struct{}` field types would cause the TypeScript generation to fail. Thanks to @ParkourLiu for the [PR](https://github.com/wailsapp/wails/pull/1999)
- When maximising a frameless window on Windows with multiple monitors, the window could sometimes become blank. Thanks to @stffabi for the [fix](https://github.com/wailsapp/wails/pull/2043)

### Alterado

- The troubleshooting guide was updated to provide guidance when [Vite fails to start](https://wails.io/docs/guides/troubleshooting#cannot-start-service-host-version-xxx-does-not-match-binary-version-xxx). Thanks to @willdot for the [PR](https://github.com/wailsapp/wails/pull/2000).
- English, Chinese and Japanese documentation updates. Thanks to @misitebao.

### Obsoleto

- The [AssetsHandler](https://wails.io/docs/reference/options#assetshandler) option has been deprecated. Please use the [AssetServer](https://wails.io/docs/reference/options#assetserver) option instead.

## v2.0.0-beta.44 - 2022-08-20

### Obsoleto

The `data-wails-drag` attribute is being deprecated in favour of the following CSS style: `style="--wails-draggable:drag"`. You can use `style="--wails-draggable:no-drag"` to disable the drag behaviour. For this release only, you can test this by setting the following application option:

```go
Experimental: &options.Experimental{

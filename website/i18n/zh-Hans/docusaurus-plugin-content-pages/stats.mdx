# 网站统计

To enable us to understand how better to focus our efforts on translations and platform support, we use [Plausible](https://plausible.io/privacy-focused-web-analytics) to gather **anonymous** stats like country and platform. We chose Plausible because we believe in respecting the privacy of our users. We also believe in transparency, therefore have made the dashboard public.

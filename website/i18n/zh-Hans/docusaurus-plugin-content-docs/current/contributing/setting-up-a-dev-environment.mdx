# 设置开发环境

You can set up a development environment by doing the following:

- Install the latest versions of Go and Git
- `git clone https://github.com/wailsapp/wails`
- `cd wails/v2/cmd/wails`
- `go install`

NOTE: The directory that you cloned the project into will now be called "clonedir".

The Wails CLI will now be at the very latest version.

To update projects to use the latest version, update the project's `go.mod` and ensure the following line is at the bottom of the file:

`replace github.com/wailsapp/wails/v2 => <clonedir>`

Example:

On Windows: `replace github.com/wailsapp/wails/v2 => C:\Users\leaan\Documents\wails-v2-beta\wails\v2`

On 'nix: `replace github.com/wailsapp/wails/v2 => /home/me/projects/wails/v2`

To revert back to a stable version, run:

`go install github.com/wailsapp/wails/v2/cmd/wails@latest`

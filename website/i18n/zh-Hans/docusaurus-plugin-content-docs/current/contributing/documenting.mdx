This website is also the main documentation site for the project. Sometimes this gets out of date and needs some slight adjustments. Some of the documentation isn't written to the best standards either. Developing documentation is hard and so any contribution to this is greatly appreciated. This website is also the main documentation site for the project. Sometimes this gets out of date and needs some slight adjustments. Some of the documentation isn't written to the best standards either. Developing documentation is hard and so any contribution to this is greatly appreciated. Features without documentation are unfinished so to the project, it's *as important* as the code.

We generally do not create tickets for updating documentation so if there is text you think should be updated or rephrased then feel free to submit a PR for that. This site is in the main repository under the `website` directory. We use [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) to create the site so there is plenty of existing documentation and tutorials around to get started.

To set up a local documentation development environment, do the following:

- [Install npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/configuring-npm/install)
- `cd website`
- `npm install`
- `npm run start`

After it has all installed and is running, you should see the site at [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000). Any changes made to the site text will be immediately reflected in the browser. Any changes made to the site text will be immediately reflected in the browser.

## Versioning

We employ a versioning system where we have the "latest" documentation AKA "Next Version" which has all the changes that have occurred since the last release. We also keep the last release documentation as well as the version before that. We also keep the last release documentation as well as the version before that.

There isn't usually a reason to update released documentation so we don't generally update the documents in the `versioned_docs` or `versioned_sidebars` directories.

The "next version" docs are mainly in `website/docs` with some "version independent" documents in `src/pages`. Any updates should be made in the `website/docs` directory. Any updates should be made in the `website/docs` directory.

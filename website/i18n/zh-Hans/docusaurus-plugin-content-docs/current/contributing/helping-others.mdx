# 帮助其他人

A great way to contribute to the project is to help others who are experiencing difficulty. This is normally reported as a ticket or a message on the Wails slack channel. Even just clarifying the issue can really help out. Sometimes, when an issue is discussed and gets resolved, we create a guide out of it to help others who face the same issues.

To join the Wails slack channel, accept the invite [here](https://gophers.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-197vymgt3-sJt4oyakb6nqlVKjXTyeVw#/shared-invite/email) and join us on the channel by following [this link](https://gophers.slack.com/?redir=%2Fmessages%2FCJ4P9F7MZ%2F).

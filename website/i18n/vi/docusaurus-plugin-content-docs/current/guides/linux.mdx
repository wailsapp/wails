## Video tag doesn't fire "ended" event

When using a video tag, the "ended" event is not fired when the video is finished playing. This is a bug in WebkitGTK, however you can use the following workaround to fix it:

```js
videoTag.addEventListener("timeupdate", (event) => {
  if (event.target.duration - event.target.currentTime < 0.2) {
    let ended = new Event("ended");
    event.target.dispatchEvent(ended);
  }
});
```

## GStreamer error when using Audio or Video elements

If you are seeing the following error when including `<Audio>` or `<Video>` elements on Linux, you may need to install `gst-plugins-good`.

```
GStreamer element autoaudiosink not found. Please install it
```

### Installing

Run the following distro relevant install command:

```mdx-code-block
import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

<Tabs
    defaultValue="Arch"
    values={[
        { label: "Arch", value: "Arch" },
        { label: "Debian/Ubuntu", value: "Debian" },
        { label: "Fedora", value: "Fedora" },
    ]}
>
<TabItem value="Arch">

    pacman -S gst-plugins-good

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Debian">

    apt-get install gstreamer1.0-plugins-good

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Fedora">

    dnf install gstreamer1-plugins-good

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

If the added package does not resolve the issue, additional GStreamer dependencies may be required. [See the GStreamer installation page for more details.](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/installing/on-linux.html)

### Additional Notes

- This issue is caused by [an upstream issue with WebkitGTK](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=146351).
- [Arch based systems](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch-based_distributions) seem to have this issue more often than other distributions.
- This issue impacts [Tauri apps](https://tauri.app/).

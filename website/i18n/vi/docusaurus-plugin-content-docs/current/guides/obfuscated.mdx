# Obfuscated Builds

Wails includes support for obfuscating your application using [garble](https://github.com/burrowers/garble).

To produce an obfuscated build, you can use the `-obfuscate` flag with the `wails build` command:

```bash
wails build -obfuscated
```

To customise the obfuscation settings, you can use the `-garbleargs` flag:

```bash
wails build -obfuscated -garbleargs "-literals -tiny -seed=myrandomseed"
```

These settings may be persisted in your [project config](../reference/project-config).

## How it works

In a standard build, all bound methods are available in the frontend under the `window.go` variable. When these methods are called, the corresponding backend method is called using the fully qualified function name. When using an obfuscated build, methods are bound using an ID instead of a name. The bindings generated in the `wailsjs` directory use these IDs to call the backend functions.

:::note

To ensure that your application will work in obfuscated mode, you must use the generated bindings under the `wailsjs` directory in your application.

:::

## Example

Importing the "Greet" method from the bindings like this:

```js
import { Greet } from "../../wailsjs/go/main/App";

// snip
Greet("World");
```

will ensure that the method will work correctly in obfuscated mode, as the bindings will be regenerated with IDs and the call mechanism updated.

[ScriptBar](https://GitHub.com/raguay/ScriptBarApp) is a program to show the output of scripts or [Node-Red](https://nodered.org) server. It runs scripts defined in EmailIt program and shows the output. Scripts from xBar or TextBar can be used, but currently on the TextBar scripts work well. It also displays the output of scripts on your system. ScriptBar doesn't put them in the menubar, but has them all in a convient window for easy viewing. You can have multiple tabs to have many different things show. You can also keep the links to your most visited web sites.

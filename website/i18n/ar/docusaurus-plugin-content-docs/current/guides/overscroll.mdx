# Overscroll

[Overscroll](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/overscroll-behavior) is the "bounce effect" you sometimes get when you scroll beyond a page's content boundaries. This is common in mobile apps. This can be disabled using CSS:

```css
html {
  height: 100%;
  overflow: hidden;
}
```

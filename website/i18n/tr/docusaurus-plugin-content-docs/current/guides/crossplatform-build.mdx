# Crossplatform build with Github Actions

To build a Wails project for all the available platforms, you need to create an application build for each operating system. One effective method to achieve this is by utilizing GitHub Actions.

An action that facilitates building a Wails app is available at:
https://github.com/dAppServer/wails-build-action

In case the existing action doesn't fulfill your requirements, you can select only the necessary steps from the source:
https://github.com/dAppServer/wails-build-action/blob/main/action.yml

Below is a comprehensive example that demonstrates building an app upon the creation of a new Git tag and subsequently uploading it to the Actions artifacts:

```yaml
name: Wails build

on:
  push:
    tags:
    # Match any new tag
      - '*'

env:
  # Necessary for most environments as build failure can occur due to OOM issues
  NODE_OPTIONS: "--max-old-space-size=4096"

jobs:
  build:
    strategy:
    # Failure in one platform build won't impact the others
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        build:
          - name: 'App'
            platform:  'linux/amd64'
            os: 'ubuntu-latest'
          - name: 'App'
            platform:  'windows/amd64'
            os: 'windows-latest'
          - name: 'App'
            platform:  'darwin/universal'
            os: 'macos-latest'

    runs-on: ${{ matrix.build.os }}
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          submodules: recursive

      - name: Build wails
        uses: dAppServer/wails-build-action@v2.2
        id: build
        with:
          build-name: ${{ matrix.build.name }}
          build-platform: ${{ matrix.build.platform }}
          package: false
          go-version: '1.20'
```

This example offers opportunities for various enhancements, including:

- Caching dependencies
- Code signing
- Uploading to platforms like S3, Supbase, etc.
- Injecting secrets as environment variables
- Utilizing environment variables as build variables (such as version variable extracted from the current Git tag)

# Introduction

The runtime is a library that provides utility methods for your application. There is both a Go and JavaScript runtime and the aim is to try and keep them at parity where possible.

It has utility methods for:

- [Window](window.mdx)
- [Menu](menu.mdx)
- [Boîte de dialogue](dialog.mdx)
- [Événements](events.mdx)
- [Browser](browser.mdx)
- [Log](log.mdx)

The Go Runtime is available through importing `github.com/wailsapp/wails/v2/pkg/runtime`. All methods in this package take a context as the first parameter. This context should be obtained from the [OnStartup](../options.mdx#onstartup) or [OnDomReady](../options.mdx#ondomready) hooks.

:::info Note

Whilst the context will be provided to the [OnStartup](../options.mdx#onstartup) method, there's no guarantee the runtime will work in this method as the window is initialising in a different thread. If you wish to call runtime methods at startup, use [OnDomReady](../options.mdx#ondomready).

:::

The JavaScript library is available to the frontend via the `window.runtime` map. There is a runtime package generated when using `dev` mode that provides TypeScript declarations for the runtime. This should be located in the `wailsjs` directory in your frontend directory.

### Cacher

Go: `Hide(ctx context.Context)`<br/> JS: `Hide()`

Cache l'application.

:::info Note

On Mac, this will hide the application in the same way as the `Hide` menu item in standard Mac applications. This is different to hiding the window, but the application still being in the foreground. For Windows and Linux, this is currently the same as `WindowHide`.

:::

### Afficher

Affiche l'application.

:::info Note

On Mac, this will bring the application back into the foreground. For Windows and Linux, this is currently the same as `WindowShow`.

:::

Go: `Show(ctx context.Context)`<br/> JS: `Show()`

### Quitter

Quitte l'application.

Go: `Quit(ctx context.Context)`<br/> JS: `Quit()`

### Environnement

Renvoie les détails de l'environnement actuel.

Go: `Environment(ctx context.Context) EnvironmentInfo`<br/> JS: `Environment(): Promise<EnvironmentInfo>`

#### EnvironmentInfo

Go:

```go
type EnvironmentInfo struct {
    BuildType string
    Platform  string
    Arch      string
}
```

JS:

```ts
interface EnvironmentInfo {
  buildType: string;
  platform: string;
  arch: string;
}
```

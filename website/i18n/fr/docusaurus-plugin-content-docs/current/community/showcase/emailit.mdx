[EmailIt](https://github.com/raguay/EmailIt/) is a Wails 2 program that is a markdown based email sender only with nine notepads, scripts to manipulate the text, and templates. It also has a scripts terminal to run scripts in EmailIt on files in your system. The scripts and templates can be used from the commandline itself or with the Alfred, Keyboard Maestro, Dropzone, or PopClip extensions. It also supports scripts and themes downloaded form GitHub. Documentation is not complete, but the programs works. Itâ€™s built using Wails2 and Svelte, and the download is a universal macOS application.

# Project Config

The project config resides in the `wails.json` file in the project directory. The structure of the config is:

```json
{
  // Project config version
  "version": "",
  // The project name
  "name": "",
  // Relative path to the directory containing the compiled assets, this is normally inferred and could be left empty
  "assetdir": "",
  // Additional directories to trigger reloads (comma separated), this is only used for some advanced asset configurations
  "reloaddirs": "",
  // The directory where the build files reside. Defaults to 'build'
  "build:dir": "",
  // Relative path to the frontend directory. Defaults to 'frontend'
  "frontend:dir": "",
  // The command to install node dependencies, run in the frontend directory - often `npm install`
  "frontend:install": "",
  // The command to build the assets, run in the frontend directory - often `npm run build`
  "frontend:build": "",
  // This command has been replaced by frontend:dev:build. If frontend:dev:build is not specified will falls back to this command. \nIf this command is also not specified will falls back to frontend:build
  "frontend:dev": "",
  // This command is the dev equivalent of frontend:build. If not specified falls back to frontend:dev
  "frontend:dev:build": "",
  // This command is the dev equivalent of frontend:install. If not specified falls back to frontend:install
  "frontend:dev:install": "",
  // This command is run in a separate process on `wails dev`. Useful for 3rd party watchers or starting 3d party dev servers
  "frontend:dev:watcher": "",
  // URL to a 3rd party dev server to be used to serve assets, EG Vite. \nIf this is set to 'auto' then the devServerUrl will be inferred from the Vite output
  "frontend:dev:serverUrl": "",
  // Relative path to the directory that the auto-generated JS modules will be created
  "wailsjsdir": "",
  // The name of the binary
  "outputfilename": "",
  // The default time the dev server waits to reload when it detects a change in assets
  "debounceMS": 100,
  // Address to bind the wails dev sever to. Default: localhost:34115
  "devServer": "",
  // Arguments passed to the application in shell style when in dev mode
  "appargs": "",
  // Defines if build hooks should be run though they are defined for an OS other than the host OS.
  "runNonNativeBuildHooks": false,
  "preBuildHooks": {
    // The command that will be executed before a build of the specified GOOS/GOARCH: ${platform} is replaced with the "GOOS/GOARCH". The "GOOS/GOARCH" hook is executed before the "GOOS/*" and "*/*" hook.
    "GOOS/GOARCH": "",

    "*/*": ""
  },
  "postBuildHooks": {
    // The command that will be executed after a build of the specified GOOS/GOARCH: ${platform} is replaced with the "GOOS/GOARCH" and ${bin} with the path to the compiled binary. The "GOOS/GOARCH" hook is executed before the "GOOS/*" and "*/*" hook.
    "GOOS/GOARCH": "",
    // The command that will be executed after a build of the specified GOOS: ${platform} is replaced with the "GOOS/GOARCH" and ${bin} with the path to the compiled binary. The "GOOS/*" hook is executed before the "*/*" hook.
    "GOOS/*": "",
    // The command that will be executed after every build: ${platform} is replaced with the "GOOS/GOARCH" and ${bin} with the path to the compiled binary.

```

This file is read by the Wails CLI when running `wails build` or `wails dev`.

The `assetdir`, `reloaddirs`, `wailsjsdir`, `debounceMS`, `devserver` and `frontenddevserverurl` flags in `wails build/dev` will update the project config
and thus become defaults for subsequent runs.

The JSON Schema for this file is located [here](https://wails.io/schemas/config.v2.json).

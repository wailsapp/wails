# Testing

Testing is vitally important to ensure quality in the project. There are a couple of
scenarios where testing can really help the project:

- Testing if a bug is reproducible on your local system
- Testing PRs to ensure that they work correctly

If you chose to test if someone's bug report is reproducible on your local system, then
feel free to add a comment on the ticket confirming this with the output of `wails doctor`.

To test PRs, choose a PR to test and check if the PR description has the testing scenarios
listed. If not, please ask the person who opened the PR to provide that list. Once you have
determined a valid test scenario, please report your findings on the PR.

If you ever need more clarity or help on testing, please ask a question in the [Contributing to Wails](https://github.com/wailsapp/wails/discussions/1520)
discussion or on slack.

[EmailIt](https://github.com/raguay/EmailIt/) is a Wails 2 program that is a markdown based email sender only with nine notepads, scripts to manipulate the text, and templates. It also has a builtin [Node-Red](https://nodered.org/) server, scripts terminal, and the [ScriptBar](https://github.com/raguay/ScriptBarApp) program for displaying results from Node-Red or a script on your system. Documentation is very scarce, but the programs works. Itâ€™s built using Wails2 and Svelte, and the download is a universal macOS application.

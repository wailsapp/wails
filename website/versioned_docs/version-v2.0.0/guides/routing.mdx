# Routing

Routing is a popular way to switch views in an application. This page offers some guidance around how to do that.

## Vue

The recommended approach for routing in Vue is [Hash Mode](https://next.router.vuejs.org/guide/essentials/history-mode.html#hash-mode):

```js
import { createRouter, createWebHashHistory } from "vue-router";

const router = createRouter({
  history: createWebHashHistory(),
  routes: [
    //...
  ],
});
```

## Angular

The recommended approach for routing in Angular is [HashLocationStrategy](https://codecraft.tv/courses/angular/routing/routing-strategies#_hashlocationstrategy):

```ts
RouterModule.forRoot(routes, { useHash: true });
```

## React

The recommended approach for routing in React is [HashRouter](https://reactrouter.com/docs/en/v6/routers/hash-router):

```jsx
import { HashRouter } from "react-router-dom";

ReactDOM.render(
  <HashRouter basename={"/"}>
    {/* The rest of your app goes here */}
    <Routes>
      <Route path="/" element={<Page0 />} exact />
      <Route path="/page1" element={<Page1 />} />
      <Route path="/page2" element={<Page2 />} />
      {/* more... */}
    </Routes>
  </HashRouter>,
  root
);
```

# Documenting

This website is also the main documentation site for the project. Sometimes this gets
out of date and needs some slight adjustments. Some of the documentation isn't written
to the best standards either. Developing documentation is hard and so any contribution
to this is greatly appreciated. Features without documentation are unfinished so to the
project, it's *as important* as the code.

We generally do not create tickets for updating documentation so if there is text you
think should be updated or rephrased then feel free to submit a PR for that. This site
is in the main repository under the `website` directory. We use [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) to create
the site so there is plenty of existing documentation and tutorials around to get started.

To set up a local documentation development environment, do the following:

- [Install npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/configuring-npm/install)
- `cd website`
- `npm install`
- `npm run start`

After it has all installed and is running, you should see the site at [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000).
Any changes made to the site text will be immediately reflected in the browser.

## Versioning

We employ a versioning system where we have the "latest" documentation AKA "Next Version" which
has all the changes that have occurred since the last release. We also keep the last release
documentation as well as the version before that.

There isn't usually a reason to update released documentation so we don't generally update
the documents in the `versioned_docs` or `versioned_sidebars` directories.

The "next version" docs are mainly in `website/docs` with some "version independent" documents
in `src/pages`. Any updates should be made in the `website/docs` directory.

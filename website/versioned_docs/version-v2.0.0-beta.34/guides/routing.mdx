# Routing

Routing is a popular way to switch views in an application. This page offers some guidance around how to do that.

## Vue

The recommended approach for routing in Vue is [Hash Mode](https://next.router.vuejs.org/guide/essentials/history-mode.html#hash-mode):

```js
import { createRouter, createWebHashHistory } from 'vue-router'

const router = createRouter({
  history: createWebHashHistory(),
  routes: [
    //...
  ],
})
```

## Angular

The recommended approach for routing in Angular is [HashLocationStrategy](https://codecraft.tv/courses/angular/routing/routing-strategies/#_hashlocationstrategy):

```ts
RouterModule.forRoot(routes, {useHash: true})
```

# Troubleshooting

An assortment of troubleshooting tips.

## My application is displaying a white/blank screen

Check that your application includes the assets from the correct directory. In your `main.go` file, you will have
something similar to the following code:

```go
//go:embed frontend/dist
var assets embed.FS
```
Check that `frontend/dist` contains your application assets.

## Mac application not valid

If your built application looks like this in finder:

<p className="text--center">
    <img src="/img/troubleshooting/invalid_mac_app.png"></img>
</p>

it's likely that your application's `info.plist` is invalid. Update the file in `build/<yourapp>.app/Contents/info.plist`
and check if the data is valid, EG check the binary name is correct. To persist the changes, copy the file back to
the `build/darwin` directory.

## Cannot call backend method from frontend with variadic arguments

If you have a backend method defined with variadic parameters, eg:
```go
func (a *App) TestFunc(msg string, args ...interface{}) error {
    // Code
}
```
calling this method from the frontend like this will fail:
```js
var msg = "Hello: "
var args = ["Go", "JS"]
window.go.main.App.TestFunc(msg, ...args).then((result) => {
    //do things here
}).catch((error) => {
    //handle error
});
```
Workaround:
```js
var msg = "Hello "
var args = ["Go", "JS"]
window.go.main.App.TestFunc(msg, args).then((result) => { //without the 3 dots
    //do things here
}).catch((error) => {
    //handle error
});
```

## I'm having getting proxy errors when trying to install Wails

If you are getting errors like this:
```
"https://proxy.golang.org/github.com/wailsapp/wails/cmd/wails/@v/list": dial tcp 172.217.163.49:443: connectex: A connection attempt failed because the connected party did not properly respond after a period of time, or established connection failed because connected host has failed to respond.
```
it's probably because the official Go Proxy is being blocked (Users in China have reported this).
The solution is to set up the proxy manually, eg:
```
go env -w GO111MODULE=on
go env -w GOPROXY=https://goproxy.cn,direct
```

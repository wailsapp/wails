The [BulletinBoard](https://github.com/raguay/BulletinBoard) application is a versatile message board for static messages or dialogs to get information from the user for a script. It has a TUI for creating new dialogs that can later be used to get information from the user. It's designed to stay running on your system and show the information as needed and then hide away. I have a process for watching a file on my system and sending the contents to BulletinBoard when changed. It works great with my workflows. There is also an [Alfred workflow](https://github.com/raguay/MyAlfred/blob/master/Alfred%205/EmailIt.alfredworkflow) for sending information to the program. The workflow also integrates with [EmailIt](https://github.com/raguay/EmailIt).

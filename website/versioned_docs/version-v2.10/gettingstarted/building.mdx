# Compiling your Project

From the project directory, run `wails build`.
This will compile your project and save the production-ready binary in the `build/bin` directory.

:::info Linux
If you are using a Linux distribution that does not have webkit2gtk-4.0 (such as Ubuntu 24.04), you will need to add `-tags webkit2_41`.
:::

If you run the binary, you should see the default application:

```mdx-code-block
<div class="text--center">
  <img
    src={require("@site/static/img/defaultproject.webp").default}
    width="50%"
    class="screenshot"
  />
</div>
<br />
```

For more details on compilation options, please refer to the [CLI Reference](../reference/cli.mdx#build).

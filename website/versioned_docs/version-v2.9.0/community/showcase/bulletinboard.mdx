The [BulletinBoard](https://github.com/raguay/BulletinBoard) application is a versital message board for static messages or dialogs to get information from the user for a script. It has a TUI for creating new dialogs that can latter be used to get information from the user. It's design is to stay running on your system and show the information as needed and then hide away. I have a process for watching a file on my system and sending the contents to BulletinBoard when changed. It works great with my workflows. There is also an [Alfred workflow](https://github.com/raguay/MyAlfred/blob/master/Alfred%205/EmailIt.alfredworkflow) for sending information to the program. The workflow is also for working with [EmailIt](https://github.com/raguay/EmailIt).

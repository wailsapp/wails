# Drag And Drop

:::

This part of the runtime handles dragging and dropping files and or folders in to the window.<br/>

To enable this functionality you have to set [EnableFileDrop](../../reference/options.mdx#enablefiledrop) to `true`
in [Application Options](../../reference/options.mdx#drag-and-drop).

### OnFileDrop

This method handles the drop event on the window.

Go: `OnFileDrop(ctx context.Context, callback func(x, y int, paths []string))`<br/>
Calls the callback function with the coordinates inside the window where the drag was released and a slice of absolute file paths.

JS: `OnFileDrop(callback: (x: number, y: number, paths: string[]) => void, useDropTarget: boolean) :void`<br/>
Calls the callback function with the coordinates inside the window where the drag was released and a slice of absolute file paths.

When the `useDropTarget` is `true` in addition to calling the callback when the drop happens, it registers event listeners on
the window that are listening for the drag coordinates and checks if the mouse is over an element that has the
[CSSDropProperty](../../reference/options.mdx#cssdropproperty) style. If the element has the required property
it adds the `wails-drop-target-active` class to the element's class list and removes it when the mouse moves off of it.


### OnFileDropOff

This method removes all registered listeners and handlers for drag and drop events.

Go: `OnFileDropOff(ctx context.Context)`<br/>
Returns: has no return value.

JS: `OnFileDropOff(): void`<br/>
Returns: has no return value.

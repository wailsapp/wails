# Frameless Applications

Wails supports applications with no frame. This can be achieved by using the [frameless](../reference/options.mdx#frameless)
field in [Application Options](../reference/options.mdx#application-options).

Wails offers a simple solution for dragging the window: Any HTML element that has the attribute "data-wails-drag" will
act as a "drag handle". This property applies to all nested elements. If you need to indicate that a nested element
should not drag, then use the attribute 'data-wails-no-drag' on that element.

The default vanilla template uses this, even though it is not frameless. The whole `body` element is tagged as draggable.
The `<div id="input" data-wails-no-drag>` is tagged as being not draggable.

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/main.css" />
  </head>

  <body data-wails-drag>
    <div id="logo"></div>
    <div id="input" data-wails-no-drag>
      <input id="name" type="text" />
      <button onclick="greet()">Greet</button>
    </div>
    <div id="result"></div>

    <script src="/main.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

:::info Fullscreen
If you allow your application to go fullscreen, this drag functionality will be disabled.

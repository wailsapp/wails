# Installation

## Supported Platforms

- Windows 10/11 AMD64/ARM64
- MacOS 10.13+ AMD64
- MacOS 11.0+ ARM64
- Linux AMD64/ARM64

## Dependencies

Wails has a number of common dependencies that are required before installation:

- Go 1.17+
- NPM (Node 15+)

### Go

Download Go from the [Go Downloads Page](https://golang.org/dl/).

Ensure that you follow the official [Go installation instructions](https://golang.org/doc/install.mdx#install). You will also need to ensure that your `PATH` environment variable also includes the path to your `~/go/bin` directory. Restart your terminal and do the following checks:

- Check Go is installed correctly: `go version`
- Check "~/go/bin" is in your PATH variable: `echo $PATH | grep go/bin`

### NPM

Download NPM from the [Node Downloads Page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). It is best to use the latest release as that is what we generally test against.

Run `npm --version` to verify.

## Platform Specific Dependencies

You will also need to install platform specific dependencies:


import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

<Tabs
        defaultValue="Windows"
        values={[
          {label: "Windows", value: "Windows"},
          {label: "MacOS", value: "MacOS"},
          {label: "Linux", value: "Linux"},
        ]}
>
  <TabItem value="MacOS">
    Wails requires that the xcode command line tools are installed. This can be done by running:<br/>

    <code>xcode-select --install</code>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Windows">
    Wails requires that the <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/">WebView2</a>{" "}
    runtime is installed. Some Windows installations will already have this installed. You can check using the{" "}
    <code>wails doctor</code> command (see below).
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Linux">Linux required the standard <code>gcc</code> build tools
    plus <code>libgtk3</code> and <code>libwebkit</code>.
    Rather than list a ton of commands for different distros, Wails can try to determine
    what the installation commands are for your specific distribution. Run <code>wails doctor</code> after installation
    to be shown how to install the dependencies.
    If your distro/package manager is not supported, please consult the <a href="/docs/guides/linux-distro-support"> Add
      Linux Distro</a> guide.</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Installing Wails

Run `go install github.com/wailsapp/wails/v2/cmd/wails@latest` to install the Wails CLI.

## System Check

Running `wails doctor` will check if you have the correct dependencies installed. If not, it will advise on what is missing and help on how to rectify any problems.

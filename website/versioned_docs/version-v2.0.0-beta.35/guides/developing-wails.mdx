# Contributing

This page is a guide on how to contribute to the Wails project.

First, a word of warning: Wails v2 has been through a number of iterations and pivots. There is a lot of code that
is either on hold or deprecated. Reading the whole project and trying to understand it may be confusing. This document
aims to focus on what is current and how to understand that.

## Bugs

For raising bugs, please open a ticket on GitHub and give it the \[v2\] label. Include the output of `wails doctor`
in the ticket to help us understand your environment.

For fixing bugs, please comment on a ticket that you'd like to take it on and we will put a label on the ticket.
It is best to use Windows as it is done in pure Go, making debugging much easier.

## Features

To request a new feature, raise a ticket so that it may be discussed. The ticket should be given the
"Feature Request" label. These will be discussed and if selected for development will be given the label
"Ready for Development".

To implement a new feature, raise a ticket as above or select a ticket with the "Ready for Development" label.

When raising a PR, be mindful to state what platforms the PR has been tested on. Any new feature will not be accepted unless it works
on all platforms (if it can).

:::warning What not to do

PRs for features with no tickets aren't helpful as there's no context to the PR and it will not be prioritised.

## Documentation

Contributing to the documentation is easy by clicking on the "Edit this page" link on any of the pages. Documentation
updates can be done ad-hoc, without a ticket.

# Developing your Application

You can run your application in development mode by running `wails dev` from your project directory. This will do the following things:

- Build your application and run it
- Bind your Go code to the frontend so it can be called from JavaScript
- Using the power of [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), will watch for modifications in your Go files and rebuild/re-run on change
- Sets up a [webserver](http://localhost:34115) that will serve your application over a browser. This allows you to use your favourite browser extensions. You can even call your Go code from the console

To get started, run `wails dev` in the project directory. More information on this can be found [here](../reference/cli.mdx#dev).
